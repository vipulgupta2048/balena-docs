        Firstly $any can also be used for filtering using
        reverse navigation resources as well, while
        the previous approach works only for FKs.
        On top of that filtering using $any is also
        faster.

        The docs previously said persistent logs were stored at
        "`/var/log/journal/<uuid>` where the UUID is device UUID". In fact, the
        UUID used in this path is not related with the device UUID: it comes
        from the "machine ID" (found at `/etc/machine-id`) that is generated by
        Systemd during the first boot.

        This came from a particular set of changes to config.txt file
        on a Raspberry Pi making the device not boot but the problem is general
        enough to apply to all devices. There are many ways of misconfiguring
        the variables to make the system not bootable, certainly more that we
        would be able to list in the docs, therefore the suggestion is to try
        in a controlled environment before rolling to production.

        I moved around a bunch of text and made sure not to mix the features of
        `build` into the sections about `deploy` (even though functionally that
        makes sense).
        Also linked to the cli reference at the end of each part (since that
        documents the options in much greater detail).

        ESR support for Nano does not appear to exist though, so keeping it
        excluded from the list for now. Have asked for confirmation of where he

        For instance, in <lang_stack> it may be appropriate to specify the

        Earlier I didn't run it in watch mode and I thought all of them work :/

        It turns out we still don't have logos in S3 for all device types, and

        half-baked solution will only make it more messy than it already is.

        Once we resolve the issue on where the images are stored and we have
        fully

        migrated to it, I'll revisit this.

        We fix the reference to config.txt having to be modified
        locally after first boot  - it's actually the other way round,
        since the supervisor will apply whatever the API says it
        should after first boot (and only what was there before
        first boot will be kept).
        We also expand on how to set dtoverlay and dtparam values,
        with the new way to set several values as an array.
        Closes #882

        Updating help contact info across the docs:

        * updating forum links

        * adding forums to lists where email and gitter options are mentioned

        * removing extra "contact us" info from some pages, as it should not be
        explicitly

        added to page content one by one, but should be in the footer in the
        future,

        or in the troubleshooting section (as it is now).

      body: The navigation needs to be updated to reflect that the base image page
        name is no longer 'resin-base-image'. This was changed as part of the
        effort to make the docs more name agnostic. A small change to the FAQ
        page is also included to account for removing 'resin' from a heading.

      body: >-
        The supported devices page was displaying anchor links for the headings
        that did not work, as the headings are not generated via markdown and
        therefore the elements don't get an ID automatically assigned. The code
        has been updated to not attach anchor links to elements without IDs.

        The table of device names was also updated to remove the parallella
        device type, as it is discontinued. A small typo was also fixed.

# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the docs! We have a few guidelines which will allow your PR to pass our CI checks and successfully merge.

## Creating Commits in line with Semantic Versioning

> **TL:DR** The docs version numbering adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). **Please include *at least one commit* in the PR that marks the change-type for the system.** 

This change-type can be specified by adding it as a prefix, i.e., `minor: Add some new feature` while creating the commit. This is so the PR can be automatically versioned and a changelog generated for it by using versionist. One can choose one of 3 `Change-type` options on the nature of the file change. 

- `patch` - For tiny changes that include typo fixes, updating screenshots, adding clarification notes, etc.
- `minor` - For moderate changes that include updating packages, rewriting documentation, adding new features.
- `major`- For substantial changes that include updating large parts of the documentation or migrating to new frameworks. 

### Creating Commits using the GitHub UI

For folks using the Github UI to create new pull requests, check out the following guides in order to get started. 

1. [Editing files and proposing changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository) on a GitHub Repository. When committing changes, here's how one can add a `Change-type` as a prefix to the commit. Adding `patch:` before the commit will mark the change-type as `patch` successfully. 

![example-prefix-commit-githubui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22801822/113337642-ac704f00-9345-11eb-9df3-43c07e06c9bf.png)

2. When the changes have been committed, [create a pull request for the proposed changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) through the GitHub UI. 

### Using the Command-Line

For folks experienced with the git command-line, when creating a commit, make sure to add the `Change-type` prefix to a commit using the following command.

```bash
git commit -m "patch: Update v8 configuration for contracts"
```

This will allow the system to version the documentation using the `Change-type` automatically. The versioning follows [semver](https://semver.org/), and changes can be of type `patch`, `minor` or `major`. Adding it as a pull request message doesn't work. Without the prefix in place, the CI checks will fail. **Again, please make sure to include *at least one commit* in the PR that marks the change-type for the system.** 

## Adding images/screenshots to the docs

> Choose whichever format that suits your need

Images and screenshots help the user in better understanding of the docs. Before adding a screenshot, make sure to keep the area in focus, text is clearly visible and doesn't have any identifying information. Rename the screenshot appropriately and make sure to upload them to the right path.

![](./static/img/common/billing/plan_selection.webp)

Do mark the menu options, buttons or tabs with a red box as and when needed.

![](./static/img/common/billing/current_plan.webp)

Images for the documentation are stored in [static/img](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/tree/master/static/img) directory. Screenshots of the dashboard are commonly stored in the [common](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/tree/master/static/img/common) directory.  

To add an image to the documentation,

1. Upload/add the image(s) to one of the folder inside the [static/img](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/tree/master/static/img) directory. One can also use the GitHub UI to [upload files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository). 
2. Images need to be uploaded in `PNG`, `JPEG`, or `SVG` format to render correctly in markdown. 
3. When added, refer and add them to the relevant documentation page using either the markdown format.

```markdown
![Description of the image](/img/common/app/cool-looking-image.webp)
```

OR use the HTML `<img>` tag

```html
<img alt="Description about the image" src="/img/common/app/cool-looking-image.webp">
```

## Adding links to the docs

> Choose whichever format that suits your need

To add links in markdown, use the format `[I'm an inline-style link](https://docs.balena.io)` which results in [I'm an inline-style link](https://docs.balena.io)

OR using `[I'm a reference-style link][reference text]` which results in [I'm a reference-style link][reference text] where `reference text` is referred at the bottom of the markdown file. These link types can be used multiple times in the same document.

More examples are given below, 

```
[multicontainer]:/learn/develop/multicontainer
[poll-interval]: /learn/manage/configuration/#variable-list
[multicontainer-project]:{{ $links.githubLabs }}/multicontainer-getting-started/tree/master/haproxy
```

Check the [links module](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/blob/master/config/links.coffee) to find link references that are being used all across the documentation and to add new ones as needed. 

## Contributing to External Documentation

It is worth noting that some of the reference documentation is sourced from the individual component repositories and should be updated at the source. 
To add additional external documentation, follow these steps:

1. Update [`tools/fetch-external.sh`](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/blob/master/tools/fetch-external.sh) to add the additional external source. If required, rename the source document as this will be used in the docs URL. This dynamically determining the `Improve this Doc` link and has to be unique. 
2. Update `externalDocs` in [`config/links.coffee`](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/blob/master/config/links.coffee) to add the link to edit the source file. This is the link presented in `Improve this Doc`. The key must match the name of the filename without the .md extension. Example, for a file named `node-sdk.md`, the key must be added like `"node-sdk": 'https://github.com/balena-io/balena-sdk/edit/master/DOCUMENTATION.md'`.
3. In [`config/index.coffee`](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/blob/master/config/index.coffee) add the filename (again without the .md extension) to the `EXTERNAL_DOCS` variable so that the system knows to identify this file as coming from an external source correctly.
4. If the source is currently duplicated in this repo, then delete the content from this repo and add the files to `/.gitignore`.

If a page is removed that may be linked externally to some other docs, do remember to add it to the `redirects.txt` in the root of the docs. If one doesn’t, then links will break, and folks will have an awful time.

Currently, the following reference material is pulled from other repositories:
- [Device Supervisor API](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/) and [Device Supervisor upgrades](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/supervisor-upgrades), sourced from https://github.com/balena-io/balena-supervisor/tree/master/docs
- [CLI](https://docs.balena.io/reference/cli/) sourced from https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/doc/cli.markdown
- [Node SDK](https://docs.balena.io/reference/sdk/node-sdk/) sourced from https://github.com/balena-io/balena-sdk/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md
- [Python SDK](https://docs.balena.io/reference/sdk/python-sdk/) sourced from https://github.com/balena-io/balena-sdk-python/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md

And more. The updated list of external resources can be found in [tools/fetch-external.sh](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/blob/master/tools/fetch-external.sh)  

## Version numbers & Changelogs

Version numbers and commit messages are automatically added to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file by the CI build flow after a pull request is merged. It should not be manually edited.

## Best Practices to follow

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the style manual and conventions to be followed while contributing to balenaCloud documentation. This helps in maintaining consistency of the documentation already written by other contributors. These best practices also help avoid common mistakes and make sure one is using templates & partials the right way.

- [Conventions & Best Practices](README.md#conventions--best-practices)
- Using [Partials](README.md#using-partials) and [Templates](README.md#using-templates)

# balenaCloud Documentation

![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/balena-io/docs)  ![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/balena-io/docs)  ![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/balena-io/docs)

Documentation for the [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/) platform lives here.  
Join our [forums](https://forums.balena.io/) to chat.

This repo intends to provide our public-facing documentation. To view the documentation generated by this repo, one could either [run locally](#getting-started) or view the [hosted version](https://www.balena.io/docs/).

## Getting Started

To get started for contributing to balenaCloud documentation, follow the steps below: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balena-io/docs.git
cd docs
npm install
npm run build
```

Now to check that everything is working correctly, start the local server with:

```
npm start
```

You should now see the docs served from [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs) running locally on your device. Running locally helps in seeing the preview of your changes quickly to improve changes.

> Note: if you are using macOS and you get `"RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" `
> when running `npm install` (which eventually calls the `build.sh` script), have a look at
> the comments at the top of the "Dockerfile.bindmount" file.

To add you changes to the docs, create a new local branch of master:

```
git checkout -b my-docs-patch
```

Now you can make changes to this branch. The docs are generated from markdown files as static pages using metalsmith.io. Hence, each time any changes are made `.md` files, a rebuild needs to be triggered to generate the static pages again. One can quickly rebuild using the command:

```
npm run build:fast
```

This command will skip over downloading files from external sources, which takes a while. However, there is a handy watch functionality that will watch for changes in `/pages`, `/shared`, and `/templates` and rebuild each time any changes are made. To use this, open a new tab in your terminal and run:

```
npm run watch-pages
```

Once you are satisfied with the changes, make the commits, push the changes and submit a pull request for your branch against `master`. Make sure to read the [CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md) before committing.

_Note_ that you have to restart the development server if you edit other things like `redirects.txt`.

## How to Contribute

If you think a part is not documented, is outdated, or can be improved on the [docs](https://docs.balena.io), don't hesitate to send a PR! Check our [CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the guidelines to ensure your PR can be merged as quickly as possible.
One can open or check existing issues on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/issues). Looking forward to seeing your contributions!

> Pro tip: Use the "Improve This Doc" button to make changes to the correct file. 

![Improve-this-doc-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22801822/113422793-ee9f9c00-93ea-11eb-90de-539e3438babb.png)

## Deploying

Shortly after merging a PR to the `master` branch, Flowzone will run on the deploy script on the master branch and deploy the docs on [balenacloud-docs.pages.dev](https://balenacloud-docs.pages.dev). The deploy script needs to install `cwebp` to convert images to webp format. At the moment, this command is only available to be run on Linux.

The docs are hosted on Cloudflare Pages as a static site. 

## Style manual

### Balena-specific words

For all instances, we use `balena` as lower-case capitalization unless beginning a sentence (Ex. *I like balena. Balena is great.*). More instances as follows,

* **balena** (used to refer to the company as a whole, not in place of balenaCloud, balenaOS or any other project)
* **balenaEtcher**
* **balenaOS** (note the capitalization of **OS**)
* **balenaEngine**
* **balenaFin**
* **balenaCloud**
* the **balena CLI**
* the **balena Supervisor**
* **openbalena**

### Conventions & Best Practices

- Notes/Warnings are formatted using CSS. Use the following syntax to make sure it's rendered correctly: `__Note:__`

- It's important to note that `h1` and `h2` headings will automatically be included on the left sidebar, so make sure to use these appropriately and sparingly.

- We also use globally accessible variables to interpolate strings, reuse variables easily and maintain consistency across the documentation to follow a consistent naming convention. 

- Module containing the variable can be found [/config](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/tree/master/config) directory with several modules for links, names, etc. containing references being used across the documentation. These references can be used inside the documentation files using fluid tags like the examples below. 

1. Reusing commonly used names as variables - `Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}`
2. Interpolating strings - `{{ $names.os.lower }} image configured`
3. Even, building links - `{{ $links.githubLabs }}/multicontainer-getting-started/tree/master/haproxy`

### Using Partials

When creating new content or altering current pages, it's recommended to try and keep things DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This is accomplished in the balenaCloud documentation by using "partials". The sub-directories of the`/shared` folder contain snippets or partials of the docs, which can be reused anywhere in the documentation. They also allow you to cleverly override a partial for a particular board type and language type. In general, most of them contain a `_default.md`, which means the default partial will be used for all boards and language types. But, for partials for sections like `getDeviceOnDash` has device-specific overrides such as the one below.

```
├── getDeviceOnDash
│   ├── _default.md
│   ├── artik10.md
│   ├── artik5.md
│   ├── raspberrypi.md
│   ├── raspberrypi2.md
│   └── raspberrypi3.md
```

To use these partials in a markdown page, all you need to do is add the following onto the page:

```
{{ import “getDeviceOnDash” }}
```

On build time, the engine will pull that partial into this location on the page. This way, pages can be generated dynamically based on specific conditions, much like the [Getting Started](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started) docs.

### Using Templates

In dynamically generated pages (the ones with the device-type and language dropdown), it is possible to use templates to dynamically change the device name and language name in your text. 

Here is an example:

```
Getting started with {{ $device.name }} using {{ $language.name }}

Select the {{ $device.name }} device type`
```

To add additional dynamic properties, see the files in `/config/dictionaries`. To learn more about dynamically generated pages, see the [README](https://github.com/balena-io/doxx) for the Doxx project, which is used to generate those pages for the balenaCloud documentation.

# This doc defines the entire LHS navigation
# _except of the in-page headings navigation (which is auto-built)_
# The top-level items are titles of the tabs
# What follows is a tree of pages
# Lines *must* be indented with 2 spaces
# Each node can be
# * plain text `Some Text`
# * plain link `[/some/link]`
# * a link with custom title `Some Text[/some/link]`
# Plain text works as a link to its first child
# Plain link gets the title from the page's metainfo
# Link with custom title gets title as defines in this file
# Empty and commented lines are ignored

# Dynamic page links are identified by referencing at least 1 $dictionary
# in the link
# Dynamic page links can have title interpolation
# In this case they should also have default title when the page is not active
# (and thus it doesn't make sense to have dynamic parts in the title)
# The syntax is
# `Default title ~ Title with {{ interpolation }}[/some/$dictionary/link]`
# The variable-specific title is optional and can be omitted

# Accessing a Device using a Gateway Device

It may not always be possible to access the device directly, especially if the
the VPN component isn't working.

Usually, we're able to stay connected to the device when the OpenVPN
service isn't running because we're using a development image, and development
images allow passwordless root connections via SSH. Had we been running a
production image, then the device would have been in the 'Offline' state, but
it would still potentially have had network access and be otherwise running
correctly. This brings up an issue though, how can we connect to a faulty
production device in the field?

The answer comes from the mechanism behind how SSH is tunneled through the VPN,
and we can actually use another device (in the 'Online' state) on the same
local network as an 'Offline' device to do this.

You will need UUIDs of both the gateway ('Online') and target ('Offline') devices,
as well as your username and, if possible, the IP address of the target device (by
default, the last seen 'Online' state IP address will be used if the IP is not passed).
Once you have these details, you can carry this out by executing the following on your
host machine:

```shell
$ ssh -t \
   -o LogLevel=ERROR \
   -p 22 $USERNAME@ssh.balena-devices.com hostvia $UUID_GATEWAY $UUID_TARGET [$IPADDR]
```

Should this not work, it's possible that the IP address has changed (and if it
has, you _will_ need to specify the correct address). To find
the potentially correct IP address is to SSH into the gateway device and run the
following script (which should work for both legacy DropBear SSH daemons and
those running on more recent balenaOS installations):

```shell
( prefix=192.168.1; \
    for i in {2..254}; \
    do \
        addr=$prefix.$i; \
        curl -s -m 1 $addr:22222 --http0.9 | grep -q "SSH-2.0" && echo $addr BALENA DEVICE || echo $addr; \
     done \
)
```

Ensure you change the `prefix` variable to the correct prefix for the local
network before starting. This script will then go through the range `$prefix.2`
to `$prefix.254`, and flag those devices it believes are potential balena
devices. This should help you narrow down the address range to try connections
to balena devices, substituting the IP address appropriately in the SSH
connection command. 

All IP addresses will be printed by the script, but those
that are potentially balena devices will show up with `BALENA DEVICE` next to
them. If you have multiple potential UUIDs, you'll need to mix and match UUIDs
and IP addresses until you find a matching combination.

You may also try using mDNS from the gateway device to locate the IP of the
target based on its hostname. Simply ping the `.local` address and grab the IP
that way:

```shell
root@9294512:~# ping -c1 $(hostname).local
PING 9294512.local (172.17.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.17.0.1: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.400 ms

--- 9294512.local ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.400/0.400/0.400 ms
...
```

# Storage Media Debugging

Sometimes issues occur with the media being used (the medium that balenaOS
and all other data is stored on, for example an SD card or eMMC drive).

This can include multiple issues, but the most common are that of exhaustion
of free space on a device, or that of SD card corruption.

#### 11.1 Out of Space Issues

A media partition that is full can cause issues such as the following:

- Failure to download release updates, or failure to start new/updated
  services after a download has occurred
- Failure for a service to store data into defined volumes
- Failure of services to start up (mostly those that need to store data that
  isn't in `tmpfs`)

Determining how much space is left on the media for a device can be achieved by
logging into the host OS and running:

```shell
root@debug-device:~# df -h

```

The `-h` switch makes the figures returned 'human readable'. Without this switch
the returned figures will be in block sizes (usually 1k or 512byte blocks).

The two main mounts where full space problems commonly occur are `/mnt/data` and
`/mnt/state`. The former is the data partition where all service images, containers
and volumes are stored. The latter is the state partition, where overlays for the
root FS (such as user defined network configurations) and the permanent logs
are stored.

There are a few ways to try and relieve out of space issues on a media drive.

##### 11.1.1 Image and Container Pruning

One fairly easy cleanup routine to perform is that of pruning the Docker tree
so that any unused images, containers, networks and volumes are removed. It
should be noted that in the day-to-day operation of the Supervisor, it attempts
to ensure that anything that is no longer used on the device _is_ removed when
not required. However, there are issues that sometimes occur that can cause this
behavior to not work correctly. In these cases, a prune should help clean
anything that should not be present:

```shell
root@debug-device:~# balena system prune -a -f --volumes
Deleted Images:
untagged: balena-healthcheck-image:latest
deleted: sha256:46331d942d6350436f64e614d75725f6de3bb5c63e266e236e04389820a234c4
deleted: sha256:efb53921da3394806160641b72a2cbd34ca1a9a8345ac670a85a04ad3d0e3507
untagged: balena_supervisor:v14.0.8

Total reclaimed space: 9.136kB
```

Note that in the above, _all_ unused images, containers, networks and volumes
will be removed. To just remove dangling images, you can use
`balena system prune -a`.

##### 11.1.2 Customer Data

Occasionally, customer volumes can also fill up the data partition. This
obviously causes more issues, because usually this is data that cannot just
be deleted. In these cases, it's imperative that the customer is informed that
they've filled the data partition and that appropriate pruning is required.
Filling disk space does not tend to stop access to devices, so in these cases
customers should be asked to enter the relevant services and manually prune
data.

Before discussion on persistent data, it's worth noting that occasionally
customer apps store data to the service container instead of a
persistent data volume. Sometimes, this data is intended as temporary, so doing
so is not an issue (although if they are doing so and expecting it to stay
permanent, this will not occur as service container rebuilds will remove the
layers where new data is stored). However there are cases where even this
temporary data can be so large that it fills the storage media. In these cases,
the Supervisor can be stopped, and then the service container affected, allowing
that container to be removed so the Supervisor can rebuild from the service
image. This will remove the layers filling the space. Care should be taken
and customers informed first, in case this data is required. They should also
be informed of persistent data and how to use it.

Because persistent data is stored as volumes, it's also possible to prune data
for a service from within the host OS. For example, should a service be filling
a volume so quickly as to prevent sensible data removal, an option is to stop
that service and then manually remove data from the service's volume.

Data volumes are always located in the `/var/lib/docker/volumes` directory. Care
needs to be taken to ensure the right volumes are examine/pruned of data, as
not all volumes pertain directly to customer data. Let's list the volumes:

```shell
root@debug-device:~# ls -l /var/lib/docker/volumes/
total 28
drwx-----x 3 root root  4096 Aug 19 19:15 1958513_backend-data
-rw------- 1 root root 32768 Aug 19 19:15 metadata.db
```

In single service apps, the relevant data volume is suffixed with the
`_balena-data` string.

In multicontainer apps, the suffix always corresponds with the name
of the bound volume. For example, let's look at the docker-compose manifest
for the `multicontainer-app` app used in this debugging masterclass:

```yaml
version: '2.1'
volumes:
  backend-data: {}
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    network_mode: host
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    labels:
      io.balena.features.supervisor-api: '1'
      io.balena.features.balena-api: '1'
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - 'backend-data:/mydata'
```

As you can see, a `backend-data` volume is defined, and then used by the
`backend` service. Assuming your device is still running the multicontainer
app for this masterclass, SSH into the device, and then examine the
running services:

```shell
root@debug-device:~# balena ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                            COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                    PORTS     NAMES
330d34540489   3128dae78199                                                     "/usr/bin/entry.sh n…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute                   backend_5302053_2266082_28d1b0e8e99c2ae6b7361f3b0f835f5c
2e2a7fcfe6f6   f0735c857f39                                                     "/usr/bin/entry.sh n…"   57 minutes ago       Up 16 minutes                       frontend_5302052_2266082_28d1b0e8e99c2ae6b7361f3b0f835f5c
e593ab6439fe   registry2.balena-cloud.com/v2/04a158f884a537fc1bd11f2af797676a   "/usr/src/app/entry.…"   57 minutes ago       Up 16 minutes (healthy)             balena_supervisor
root@debug-device:~# balena inspect backend_5302053_2266082_28d1b0e8e99c2ae6b7361f3b0f835f5c | grep /var/lib/docker/volumes
                "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/1958513_backend-data/_data",
```

The volume is denoted with the suffix of the defined volume name.
Should there be multiple volumes, then appropriate directories for these will
be created in the `/var/lib/docker/volumes` directory, with the relevant
suffixes.

Knowing this, it becomes fairly simple to stop services that have filled volumes
and to clear these out:

1. Stop the Supervisor and start timer (`balena-supervisor.service` and
   `update-balena-supervisor.timer`).
2. Determine the relevant data directories for the volumes filling the data
   partition.
3. Clean them appropriately.
4. Restart the Supervisor and start timer.

#### 11.2 Storage Media Corruption

Many device types use storage media that has high wear levels. This includes
devices such as the Raspberry Pi series, where SD cards are the usual storage
media. Because we recommend very hard-wearing cards (the SanDisk Extreme Pro
family are extremely resilient), we don't regularly have issues with customer devices
dying due to SD card failure. However, they do occur (and not just on SD cards,
any type of flash memory based storage includes a shorter lifespan compared to
media such as platter drives). Initially, media corruption and wearing exhibit
'random' signs, including but not limited to:

- Release updates failing to download/start/stop.
- Services suddenly restarting.
- Devices not being mapped to device nodes.
- Extreme lag when interacting with services/utilities from the CLI.
- Spurious kernel errors.

In fact, media corruption could potentially exhibit as _any_ sort of issue,
because there's (generally) no way to determine where wearing may exhibit
itself. Additionally, we have seen issues where media write/reads take so
long that they also adversely impact the system (for example, healthchecks
may take too long to occur, which could potentially restart services including
the Supervisor and balenaEngine), in these cases swapping the media for a
known, working brand has caused this issues to be resolved.

One quick check that can be carried out is the root filing system integrity
check. This checks the MD5 hashes fingerprints of all the files in the filing
system against those when they were built. This tends to give an idea of
whether corruption may be an issue (but it certainly isn't guaranteed).
SSH into your device and run the following:

```shell
root@debug-device:~# grep -v "/var/cache/ldconfig/aux-cache" /balenaos.fingerprint | md5sum --quiet -c -
```

If the check returns successfully, none of the files differ in their MD5
fingerprints from when they were built.

Generally, if it appears that media corruption may be an issue, we generally
check with customers if they're running a recommended media brand, and if
not ask them to do so.

Should the worst happen and a device is no longer bootable due to filesystem
corruption, they still have the option of recovering data from the device.
In this case, they'll need to remove the media (SD card, HDD, etc.) from the
device and then follow appropriate instructions.

Similar commands to check for storage corruption although can sometime provide false positives. 

```bash
journalctl -n 10000 | grep "corrupt|Data will be lost|block allocation failed|invalid magic|dockerd: error -117|EXT4-fs error|error count since last fsck|failed checksum|checksum invalid|Please run e2fsck|I/O error"
```

Messages from the command output should be carefully observed and verified to troubleshoot storage corruption.

##### Can I use multiple containers?

Multiple container fleets are supported, beginning with {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0. To run multiple containers, you will need to have a [microservices fleet][app-types] and include a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of your project. You can reference the [multicontainer documentation][multicontainer] for more details on the supported configurations.

If you are running a Docker-in-Docker setup, which builds a single container on the {{ $names.company.lower }} servers but has a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project, you'll want to rename the file to something like `dind-compose.yml`. Then when you run Docker Compose in your container, you can use the `-f` flag with the new file name: `docker-compose -f dind-compose.yml up`.

##### Can I mix device types in a fleet?

It is possible to have devices of [different types][device-types] in the same fleet, as long as they have the same or compatible architectures. For example, you could have a fleet with both Raspberry Pi 3 and BeagleBone Black devices, as they both use an ARMv7 processor. Or you could have both a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Raspberry Pi Zero, each provisioned with its device specific host OS image, but running the same ARMv6 container image. However, you could not have any Intel NUC devices as part of the same fleet, as those devices have x86-64 processors.

Regardless of type, all devices in your fleet will get the same container images. This means that if you have mixed device types you'll need to use an architecture-specific [base image][base-image] in your [Dockerfile][dockerfile], rather than one based on device type.

##### How do I push a new git repo to a fleet?

If you have pushed a repository called `project-A` to your fleet and at a later stage you would like to push a new project called `project-B`, you can do this by adding the remote (`git remote add {{ $names.company.short }} <USERNAME>@git.{{ $names.cloud_domain }}:<USERNAME>/<APPNAME>.git`) to `project-B`'s local repository. You can then easily push `project-B` to your fleet by just doing `git push {{ $names.company.short }} master -f`. The extra `-f` on the command forces the push and resets the git history on the git remote on {{ $names.company.lower }}'s backend. You should now have `project-B` running on all the devices in the fleet. Note that once you have successfully switched to `project-B` you no longer need to add the `-f` on every push, for more info check out the docs on [forced git pushes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#git-push--f).

##### Why does /data report weird usage?

On the device we have a writable data partition that uses all the free space remaining after reserving the required amount for the host os. This data partition contains the Docker images for the {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor and the user containers so that they can be updated, along with containing the persistent `/data` for the services to use, this way it avoids reserving a specific amount of space for either images or data and then finding out that we have reserved too much or too little for one. So the space usage in `/data` being used but not accounted for will likely be due to the Docker images. (As a side note if you want the most accurate usage stats you should use `btrfs fi df /data` as `df` is not accurate for btrfs partitions).

##### What NTP servers do the devices use?

NTP servers used by devices are enumerated on the [time management][ntp-servers] documentation page.

##### What network ports are required?

Please take a look at the [networking requirements][networking-requirements] section of our documentation.

##### Can I use {{ $names.cloud.lower }} in countries with restrictive firewalls such as China?

{{>"general/country-firewall"}}

##### Can I access /dev and things like GPIO from the container?

If your fleet uses a single container, it will be run in privileged mode by default and will have access to hardware in the same way as a vanilla Linux system.

For fleets running [multiple containers][multicontainer], you will either need to define services as privileged or use the `cap_add` and `devices` settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file to map in the correct hardware access to the container.

##### Can I set a static IP address for my device?

Yes! It's actually pretty easy. Have a look at the [network setup][static-ip] section of our documentation. In general, most network configurations can be achieved by changing the NetworkManager configuration file.

##### Why can't I SSH into or run code in older versions of the host OS?

While you’ve always been able to SSH into your container, we had previously restricted SSH access to the host OS. We had a number of reasons for doing this:

- Code in the host OS currently isn't kept inside a container, so we are unable to track or update it at all.
- If code run in the host OS inadvertently kills our supervisor or overwrites critical data (such as data used to identify it), the device could become inaccessible and no longer updateable.
- Configuration of network device drivers, mount points, security provisions, and many other details have been carefully chosen to serve the {{ $names.company.lower }} ecosystem and your containers. Rogue code running in the host OS might interfere with this, leading to issues or degradation of performance which we would likely not be able to help you with.
- When troubleshooting issues we base our assumptions on the host OS behaving as we expect it to. If you have made changes here, there's a good chance we won't be able to reproduce the issues locally and therefore won't be able to help you.

However, we've heard from users that they would still like to be able to SSH into the host OS on their devices, so we decided to add that capability starting with {{ $names.os.lower }} version 2.7.5. This gives you access to logs and tools for services that operate outside the scope of your container, such as NetworkManager, Docker, cloudlink, and the supervisor. For more details, please check out [this documentation](/runtime/runtime/#accessing-the-host-os).

##### Which data is persisted on devices across updates/power cycles?

The only data we [guarantee to be persisted][persistent-storage] across reboot, shutdown and device update/container restart is the contents of the `/data` folder, or any [named volumes][named-volumes] on devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0 and above.
However, when a device is restarted or power cycled the container is not recreated, meaning all the data that was present in the container's filesystem before, remains.
It's very important not to rely on this behavior, as containers are recreated on release updates, when environment variables are changed in the UI or API, or when a fleet restart is requested.

##### Why does /data disappear when I move a device between fleets?

Persistent data is specific to a fleet. If you move devices between fleets running different code, then keeping persistent data from the old fleet could potentially cause issues.

On devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} versions before 2.12.0, if you move the device back to the old fleet you'll find `/data` remains intact. Newer {{ $names.os.lower }} versions automatically purge named volumes when a device is moved to a new fleet.

##### It appears that there is a centralized master running (in cloud) and agents running on devices. Is that accurate?

Yes. In fact there are multiple services running on the cloud and the devices communicate with some of them. On the device we run our agent in a Docker container, like user-deployed containers.

##### What type of encryption do you use over OpenVPN? SSL/TLS/AES-256? Mutual key authentication? over SSH?

The VPN connection is TLS with the default ciphersuite negotiation settings which today boil down to DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA. We use certificates to authenticate the server to the client and API keys to authenticate the client to the server.

##### What is the performance impact on the gateway device due to encryption?

There isn't any. The VPN connection is only used for short messages sent by our servers to the device and for device URL traffic. Internet traffic is routed normally, outside the VPN, therefore doesn't go through the encryption/decryption process.

##### How long does the update process run typically? Do you have any benchmark data? For now it appears to be quick for small updates.

The update process currently depends on the size of the update and the speed of the Internet connection. The size of the update is currently the size of the Docker layers that differ between the Docker image on the device and the Docker image of the newly pushed code. We currently have a [delta-mechanism](/runtime/delta/), which calculates binary difference between two images, which will drop the update size significantly, even on cases where no Docker layers are shared. If you are interested in testing this out, check out the [delta updates](/runtime/delta/) documentation.

##### How does the device registration work over the VPN and how do you ensure the identity of the device on the first-time registration?

The OS image you download from the UI has embedded credentials that allow the device to join your fleet without user input on boot. You should keep your downloaded images private.

##### If the device is installed behind a proxy/firewall and can’t be reachable on internet via direct connection, what are the pitfalls?

The {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor needs to be able to access our cloud services in order for you to be able to manage your device. When the device is disconnected from the internet it still continues to run the last release it obtained.

##### How do you secure your own cloud to prevent malicious attack which may allow attacker to break-in to our systems?

Generally, we try to follow good OPSEC practices for our systems. We support 2FA for user accounts and force all the connections to be over HTTPS. More details on our approach can be found on our [security page][security].

##### How long is a balenaOS release maintained for?

BalenaOS comes in two flavors, a rolling release and an [Extended Support Release (ESR)](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/OS/extended-support-release/). Rolling releases stop being maintained as soon as a new release is out. In other words, only the latest balenaOS release is maintained. ESR releases receive bug and security fixes for 9 months after its release date.

##### When are device types discontinued?

Device types are [discontinued](#what-does-it-mean-when-a-device-type-is-discontinued) in {{ $names.os.lower }} when the manufacturer discontinues support for them. This usually happens either when the device is end-of-life and manufacturing is stopped, or when software updates by the manufacturer stop happening and updating the device type's software is no longer possible. Customers using discontinued devices do it at their own risk and are advised to move to a different platform as soon as possible.

##### What does it mean when a device type is discontinued?

Discontinued devices will continue to work as usual and will be able to use all balenaCloud functionality available at the time of the last {{ $names.os.lower }} release. However, discontinued devices will no longer receive new balenaOS releases, except for [Extended Support Releases](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/OS/extended-support-release/) that will continue to receive bug and security fixes for 9 months from the ESR release date. Balena will no longer offer support for discontinued devices on the paid support channels, but support is available in the forums.

Discontinued devices may still be maintained by the community by [building your own]({{ $links.githubOS }}/meta-balena/blob/master/contributing-device-support.md) board-specific versions using our [open source repositories]({{ $links.githubOS }}). Please contact sales@{{ $names.email_domain }} with any questions regarding continued device support.

##### I have a device that is not on the supported devices list. Can it run on {{ $names.company.lower }}?

There are a few options for devices that do not have an official device type on {{ $names.company.lower }}. If your device has an x86 architecture, you can try either the [Intel NUC][nuc] image (which is built to support generic x86 devices with a minimum set of drivers), or the generic [genericx86-64][genericx86-64] image (that includes all the standard X86 drivers). For other devices, you can [build your own][build-your-own] version of {{ $names.os.lower }} using our [open source repos][balenaos]. To discuss custom board support, please contact sales@{{ $names.email_domain }}.

##### What to keep in mind when choosing power supply units?

Power supply units (PSUs) are a critical component to any widespread production deployment, as mentioned in our [Going to Production][go-to-production] guide. When buying a PSU for your hardware, be sure to inspect and understand the board's power requirements carefully. Current requirements (measured in Amps) are just as important as the voltage requirements (measured in Volts). A PSU that provides a higher voltage than required may damage the board, but a supplied voltage that is too low may cause the board to malfunction or fail to boot. If the PSU isn't capable of providing the maximum current that the board demands, then the board might eventually fail to perform under CPU-intensive loads. As the load increases, more current is drawn than the PSU can supply, which could lead to brown-outs (i.e., the board unexpectedly resetting, causing filesystem corruption). When buying PSUs or using the official power adapters, proper research is recommended to prevent scenarios like these in a production deployment.

##### Does {{ $names.company.lower }} have access to my device, source code and images?

Device access is granted to a subset of {{ $names.company.lower }} employees to [enable support and device troubleshooting](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/support-access). This access is controlled by ssh key access and only after access is explicitly granted to balena.
Release source code and images are stored on {{ $names.company.lower }} backend servers with access limited only to administrative/operational staff and are not exposed to anyone outside of {{ $names.company.lower }}. It is also possible to bypass the {{ $names.company.lower }} builder entirely and push only pre-built artifacts, meaning that {{ $names.company.lower }} never has access to the code at any point.

### What are generic architecture images?

BalenaOS is primarily used in embedded devices, that is, devices with a dedicated function and mostly static hardware. However, non-embedded type hardware is increasingly being used and is supported with the generic architecture images. These general purpose images are designed to support the widest possible hardware for the supported architectures. They can also be used to run balenaOS virtualized, for example using [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org), in servers or even consumer motherboards, and they are used as a base for balenaOS AWS images.

BalenaOS currently offers the following choice of generic architecture images:

* **Generic x86_64 (MBR)**: These are generic architecture images that use the [Master Boot Record (MBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) partition table. They are only recommended for legacy hardware that uses an MBR bootloader.
* **Generic x86_64 (GPT)**: These are generic architecture images that use the [GUID Partition Table (GPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table). These are recommended for any new [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI) x86_64 device, including modern Intel NUC devices.
* **Generic AARCH64**: These are generic architecture images recommended for any new UEFI ARM64 device.

### What is the difference between the Intel NUC and the Generic x86_64 images?

The Intel NUC images are images purposely built to match the Intel NUC hardware. They will probably work on other x86_64 device but lack support for hardware that is not available on Intel NUCs. Modern Intel NUCs are better supported using the [Generic Architecture Images](#what-are-generic-architecture-images) described above.

# Troubleshooting information for {{$device.name}}

### Terminal Closes On Update

When you push updates, the terminal session is automatically closed. To restart the terminal session, simply close the terminal session and restart it once the update is complete.

### Can't Login to the Dashboard

In some cases social logins can be disrupted or completely borked by Adblocker or browser extensions such as [BrowserShark](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browsershark/jhbjnipjccjloncefdoknhicbnbjaefh?hl=en). Make sure to disable these extensions or whitelist the `*.{{ $names.cloud_domain }}` domains.

### I get `$'\r': command not found` when my device tries to run scripts
Line endings differ between Windows and the Unix-y world (they used to be different again for Mac but not for many years), which can result in issues. E.g. a user seeing something like:
/usr/src/app/run.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found

To resolve this, you will need to configure git to automatically convert line endings. In order to configure this for Windows have a look here: https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-windows.

### Device keeps dropping off wifi
If your device keeps dropping offline, it may be worth switching to a 5GHz band wifi dongle, as we have seen cases where 2.4GHz gets badly affected by surrounding noise.

### Unsupported Syscall: 384 from qemu on builder
The qemu: Unsupported syscall: 384 is a warning that the getrandom(2) system call is not implemented by our emulation layer, qemu. It can be safely ignored. Since it's a fairly new system call (introduced in kernel 3.17), `apt` and almost all programs automatically fall back to reading from `/dev/urandom` when this syscall fails.

### Help! My device won't show up.

If your device still hasn't shown up on your dashboard after 10 minutes, something is definitely wrong. First check that you entered the WiFi credentials correctly (if you need help fixing your credentials, see [WiFi Help][wifiHelp]) and ensure that your network meets these [basic requirements][networkRequirements]. If the device has a LED indicator, it may also be worth checking it for any known error codes or signals.

If you have an HDMI screen attached, you should see balena logo on the screen when the device boots. If instead you see rainbow colors or a blank screen, it could mean that the SD card was not burned correctly or is corrupted.

{{import "troubleshooting"}}

If you still can't get your device online, come on over and talk to us on our [support channel][usingSupport].

### This is the wrong balena device.

If you see this error, there are several potential causes, including:
- The config.json file is missing or corrupted
- The UUID in the config.json file does not match the device's UUID
  - This could be caused by config.json corruption or storage corruption
- You are attempting to SSH into a device using the wrong IP address

Please contact [balena support][usingSupport] if you encounter this issue so that we can investigate the root cause.

# Account management

## Sign up

{{> "general/signUp"}}

## Password reset

If you forget your password, you may request to reset it via the [password reset][password-reset] page. Enter the email address associated with your {{ $names.cloud.lower }} account. If the email address has an associated account, a password reset link will be sent to that address. Following the link, you will be able to enter a new password.

## Add a password to social login

To add a password to an account created with a social login (Google, Github), navigate to the [*Preferences*][prefs] page found by clicking on your profile in the top right of the dashboard. Under the *Account details* tab you can set a password for your account.

## Access tokens

Access tokens are used for authentication in the {{ $names.company.lower }} [API][api], [CLI][cli], and [Node.js][node-sdk] and [Python][python-sdk] SDKs. They are managed in the *Access tokens* tab of the [*Preferences*][prefs] page, which can be found via the dropdown menu in the upper-right corner of the dashboard:

<img src="/img/common/preferences/access_tokens.webp" width="100%">

There are two types of access tokens: session tokens and API keys. Both authentication types provide user-level permissions, meaning any user or application with one of these tokens can make changes across devices, fleets, and the user account.

### Session tokens

Session tokens are retrieved from the *Preferences* page, and they can be refreshed with the [API][api-refresh]. These tokens expire after seven days, and they cannot be revoked.

### API keys

API keys are named tokens that do not expire and can be revoked as needed. To create a new API key, make sure you are in the *Access tokens* tab of the *Preferences* page, then select *Create API key*:

<img alt="Create API Key" src="/img/common/preferences/create_api_key.webp" width="100%">

You'll see a required field for *Token name*, as well as an optional field for *Token description*:

<img alt="Name API Key" src="/img/common/preferences/api_key_name.webp" width="60%">

When you click *Create token*, you will see a dialog with the new API key:

<img alt="API Key Warning" src="/img/common/preferences/api_key_warning.webp" width="80%">

__Warning:__ This is your **only** opportunity to see the key, so make sure to download or copy to a secure location!

After you close the dialog, you'll see your API key in the list, complete with name, date of creation, and description:

<img alt="List API Keys" src="/img/common/preferences/api_key_list.webp" width="100%">

To revoke one or more API keys, select the boxes to the left of the tokens you wish to remove, then click *Delete selected*:

<img alt="Delete API Key" src="/img/common/preferences/api_key_delete.webp" width="100%">

API keys can also be generated using the API, [CLI][cli-keys], and [Node.js][node-sdk-keys] and [Python][python-sdk-keys] SDKs.

## Fleet members

When a fleet needs to be shared with more than one user, the fleet owner can add new members. Check out [fleet members][team] to understand member types, how to add a member and more.


## Two-factor Authentication

We offer the option to enable [Two-factor Authentication][2fa] - this is a feature that prompts you to input a code from your smartphone/computer *in addition* to your password, providing an additional layer of security for your account.

__Note:__ We use the industry standard [Time-based One-time Password Algorithm][totp] to implement this functionality.

### Enabling Two-factor Authentication

[Sign up][signup] for an account (or [log in][login] if you already have one) and go to your [preferences][prefs] page. From here, click on the *Two-factor Authentication* tab then click *Enable two-factor authentication* to enable:

<img alt="Enable two-factor authentication" src="/img/common/preferences/enable_2fa.webp" width="100%">

Next, you will be shown a QR code and prompted for a pairing code as shown below:

__Note:__ Two-factor authentication will only be enabled once you have finished configuring it against your smartphone/computer, so no need to worry about logging out before finishing the configuration then not having access to your account!

<img alt="Two-factor authentication pairing" src="/img/common/preferences/pairing_2fa.webp" width="80%">

In order to use your phone/computer as your added layer of security you will need to download a free authenticator app. There are many available, but one that works well and has been successfully tested against {{ $names.company.lower }} is [Google Authenticator][google-auth] - download it for [Android][google-auth-android] or [iOS][google-auth-ios].

Once installed, navigate to the barcode scanner:

__Note:__ The Android app is shown here - if you already have accounts installed, tap the 3 vertical dots in the top right-hand corner and select 'Set up account', otherwise you should be given the option when you first start the app.

![Google Authenticator Scan Barcode Menu](/img/screenshots/2fa3mobile1.webp)

When you tap the option to scan a barcode your phone will turn on your camera and all you need to do to pair with your account is to simply point it at the QR code displayed on your monitor.

Once configured, you'll see a 6 digit generated code with a graphic beside it indicating a countdown. Once the countdown expires, the code becomes invalid:

![Google Authenticator Codes](/img/screenshots/2fa3mobile2.webp)

Next, you'll need to input the displayed code into the 'Pairing code' input on the preferences page. If successful, you will be shown recovery codes that may be used in the event that you cannot access your two-factor authentication app. These codes should be downloaded and stored in a safe place.

<img alt="Two-factor authentication recovery codes" src="/img/common/preferences/recovery_codes_2fa.webp" width="100%">

Once you've downloaded your recovery codes and clicked _OK_, the next time you log in, you will be prompted for the code displayed in your authenticator app after you've input your username and password. Enjoy your added layer of security!

To disable two-factor authentication, visit the _Two-factor Authentication_ tab of the _Account Preference_ and click _Disable two-factor authentication_. You will be prompted for your account password before it is disabled.

<img alt="Two-factor authentication recovery codes" src="/img/common/preferences/disable_2fa.webp" width="100%">

### List of verified authenticator apps

* [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)
* [Authy](https://www.authy.com)
* [1Password](https://1password.com)

## Delete account

If you wish to delete your {{ $names.cloud.lower }} account, go to your [_Preferences_][prefs] page, and under the _Account Details_ tab, select the _Delete Account_ button. You will need to confirm this action by entering your password. If your account does not have a password, you will be prompted to set one in your account preferences. Upon confirmation, the account will be permanently deleted, including all fleets and devices. If you would also like to request deletion of your data in accordance with GDPR, please refer to the instructions in our [privacy policy][privacy-policy].

# Billing

Billing in balenaCloud is managed through [organizations][organizations]. To manage billing for a specific organization, navigate to the organization and select the `Billing` tab from the sidebar on the left:

<img src="/img/common/billing/billing_nav.webp" width="25%">

From this dashboard, you can change your billing plan, update your billing information, monitor your usage, and download invoices. If you have any questions about billing for your account, please contact [our customer success team][solutions].

## Changing your billing plan

To modify or upgrade your billing plan, click the "Change plan" button on the billing page:

<img src="/img/common/billing/current_plan.webp" width="100%">

Select the plan you'd like to upgrade to from the list of available options:

<img src="/img/common/billing/plan_selection.webp" width="100%">

Enter your billing information and complete the signup process:

<img src="/img/common/billing/billing_info.webp" width="50%">

If you need to downgrade or cancel your plan, you can follow the steps mentioned above by choosing a lower tier or free plan instead.

Certain plans may require you to contact our customer success team in order to complete an upgrade or downgrade. If you find yourself in this situation, please contact [our customer success team][solutions].

## Account settings and usage

At the top of the billing page, you'll find a summary of your subscription with information on the total amount and due date for your next payment:

<img src="/img/common/billing/sub_sum.webp" width="100%">

Beneath this you can see your current usage, including [active devices][inactive] and collaborators:

<img src="/img/common/billing/usage.webp" width="80%">

Further down, you'll find a place to download invoices, add or edit payment methods, and update account information:

<img src="/img/common/billing/account_details.webp" width="100%">

At the bottom of this page, you'll find more information on the available [plans][plans], and you can change plans as necessary.

## Credits

To enable customers to drive down their device usage costs, balena has an optional credit-based purchasing model available. A credit represents a pre-purchased unit that corresponds to the usage of one device exceeding plan allowance for one month. At the end of each monthly billing cycle, any available credits are used first before a dynamic charge is initiated. This system is available for all non-Prototype customers.

Credit purchases of any size will result in paying less for device usage on the platform. The greater your volume in a single purchase, the lower your per-credit cost will be. The discount computation also takes into account the previously purchased credits that haven't been used. This means that you can continue to "top off" your credits to maintain better discounts. To estimate credit costs, head over to the [Paying With Credits](https://www.balena.io/pricing/#devices) section of our pricing page.

To manage credits, navigate to the organization and select the `Credits` tab from the sidebar on the left:

<img src="/img/common/billing/credits_nav.webp" width="25%">

On the Credits page, you're able to see credit purchase history and the number of credits that have been purchased and are still allocatable for device usage. This is also where you can initiate credit purchases. An invoice will be automatically generated and listed on the Billing page when a credit purchase is initiated.

__Note:__ Unused credits will expire 10 years after the date of purchase. If there is no activity for 2 years we may at our discretion cancel any outstanding credits and will provide 60 days notice to the customer of our intention to do so. Credit purchases are non-refundable and cannot be refunded due to project or plan cancellation. Credits are also non-transferrable between organizations. Credits only apply to `Microservices` [fleet types][fleet-types] and must be purchased at least 24 hours before your monthly billing renewal date.

## Dynamic billing

Any usage above what is included in your current billing plan or covered by credits will be tracked and billed dynamically in arrears. Dynamic billing will occur every month, even for those on annual plans.

For both devices and users, usage is calculated based on the maximum number in your account at any point during the month after any available credits have been used. __This includes all [active devices][inactive], whether online or offline.__

As an example, let's say you are on the Pilot plan, which includes up to 50 devices and 3 users. In one month, your active device count steadily climbs from 43 to 52. During this same month, you temporarily increase your user count from 3 to 4, before returning it to 3 at the end of the month. Based on this usage, your dynamic billing charges for the month will include an additional 2 devices and 1 user.

Furthermore, we charge a device or user only once for the most feature-rich usage tier within the same billing period. For example, a user was assigned a Developer role for the first half of the billing period and was later reassigned the Operator role for the second half of the billing period. In this scenario, we would charge the usage as a Developer role for the entire billing period. This is because the Developer role is a more feature-rich usage tier than the Operator role, as seen in [fleet membership types][fleet-membership-types]. It's important to note that we are not double charging for the same user.

Charges for usage outside your plan will show up under the _Add-ons_ section of your invoice. If you prefer, you can still contact us to pre-purchase users and have them added to your plan, rather than be automatically billed in arrears for additional devices and users. To pre-purchase devices, consider using credits.

## Inactive devices

If you have devices that will be inactive (powered off) for long periods of time, you can mark them as `Inactive`. This will keep them from being counted towards your device total. We’ll charge a one-time deactivation fee of $2, and the devices will remain inactive until they come online.
If you deactivate a device within 72 hours of first provisioning/registration, we will not charge a deactivation fee.

Marking a device as `Inactive` is a [device setting][device-settings]. Device operations can be applied in one of three ways: as a group operation applied to one or more devices in the device list, as an operation selected from the dropdown on the device dashboard, or directly from the _Settings_ tab of the device dashboard. Once a device has been marked `Inactive`, it will be faded out in the device list.

## Inactive vs Offline Devices

To understand the difference between inactive and offline devices, we define them in the following ways:

- __Inactive__: The device has been either [deactivated](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/actions/#deactivate-device) or [preregistered](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/more/masterclasses/advanced-cli/#52-preregistering-a-device) but hasn't connected to the balenaCloud API yet.
- __Offline__: The device is not connected to cloudlink and didn't have any recent API communications.

If you have a device __offline and active__, you will __still be billed for that device__. Those devices are usually still deployed in the field and ready to be used at any time. If you make the decision to have your devices offline intentionally, you will still be able see them in your fleet and can take some actions such as applying updates, that will take effect as soon as they come online.

Once you deactivate a device, you will not be able to monitor nor apply updates to that device. After the de-activation fee is charged, you won't be charged again until the device comes back online.

## Device Freezing

In the event that your balena invoices are overdue, all devices under that organization in the balenaCloud dashboard may be "frozen". Frozen devices will continue to run their application containers as usual, but users will no longer be able to access or manage those devices from the dashboard until the overdue invoices are paid and the devices are unfrozen. Frozen devices are indicated by a snowflake icon in the dashboard.

Users can determine which invoices are overdue under their organization's billing page. To settle overdue payments, update your payment method or contact the customer success team at <solutions@balena.io>.

title: Enterprise Single Sign-On
excerpt: Setup balenaCloud SSO authentication using SAML 2.0
---

# Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)

__Note:__ This feature is available to customers on [standard paid plans](https://www.balena.io/pricing) - Prototype Plan, Pilot Plan, Production Plan, or Enterprise Plan.

BalenaCloud Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) allows organizations to manage user access and authentication through their existing Identity Providers (IdP). This integration enables users to use their corporate credentials to log in and access BalenaCloud services. By leveraging SAML, enterprises can simplify the login process, enhance security, streamline user management, and ensure compliance with their internal policies and procedures.

Configuring an Identity Provider (IdP) as a login method requires a one-time setup process within both balenaCloud and the IdP itself. Refer to our [IdP specific documentation][ms-saml] for detailed instructions on required configurations.

## Link a SAML Identity Provider

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for balenaCloud organizations, you must establish a connection with your external Identity Provider (IdP). BalenaCloud supports all SAML 2.0 Identity Providers, and we provide examples for [Microsoft Entra ID][ms-saml] (formerly Azure AD) and [Google Workspace][google-saml]. This process assumes that you have already configured a [SAML 2.0 IdP and possess an XML certificate][ms-saml] ready for upload.

1. To configure an Identity Provider, you must be logged in as the Administrator of an organization subscribed to a [standard paid plan](https://www.balena.io/pricing) (Prototype Plan, Pilot Plan, Production Plan, or Enterprise Plan).
2. From the balenaCloud dashboard, select the [Identity Provider](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/identity-provider) option from the left sidebar.
3. Click on the Add Identity Provider button. In the dialog that appears, either upload the XML file or manually enter the IdP details.

<img alt="Screenshot of Add Identity Provider form" src="/img/common/saml/add-idp-form-filled.webp" width="100%">

To create an Identity Provider entity, start by first selecting a unique SSO identifier. This identifier will be part of your team's URL for logging in. For instance, if your organization is `ACME Corp`, you can choose your unique SSO identifier as `acme` and your team's login URL will be `https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/saml/acme`.

This identifier must be unique within balenaCloud and can only include lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`). 

### Associate Organizations and Teams

BalenaCloud requires a list of organizations to which SAML users will be automatically added upon successful authentication. Only organizations subscribed to a [standard paid plan](https://www.balena.io/pricing) (Prototype Plan, Pilot Plan, Production Plan, or Enterprise Plan) will appear in the list of available organizations. At least one organization must be provided when setting up the IdP.

__Note:__ Removing organizations after IdP creation will not revoke access for SAML users who have previously authenticated with this IdP. However, new authentications will no longer include the removed organization. An IdP will always require at least one organization to be associated.

You have successfully configured SAML 2.0 for your balenaCloud Enterprise SSO. Your team can now access balenaCloud securely and seamlessly through the configured Identity Provider. For instructions on how your team can log in, refer to [Authenticating as a SAML/SSO User](#authenticating-as-a-samlsso-user). If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please contact our support team.

<img alt="Fully configured IdP with two organizations associated" src="/img/common/saml/idp-with-two-orgs.webp" width="100%">

#### (Optional) Configure a Default Team

You can configure a default team for each organization to which SAML users will be automatically added upon authentication.

__Note__: If you unlink the default team in the Identity Provider configuration, it will not remove team access for SAML users who have already authenticated. However, new SAML users will no longer be automatically added to this team.

## Authenticating as a SAML User

### Setting up a new SAML user

To log in using your enterprise SAML authentication, you must first have or [create](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) a standard balenaCloud account using your company email address. Once logged in to this account, navigate to your [user preferences](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/preferences/details) and click "Enable" in the "Enterprise SSO" section.

<img alt="User preferences with Enable SSO button highlighted" src="/img/common/saml/merge-account-accept.webp" width="100%">

Next, provide the company `SSO Identifier` supplied by your balenaCloud organization administrator.

<img alt="Enable SSO modal with SSO identifier filled in." src="/img/common/saml/add-sso-identifier-merge-modal.webp" width="60%">

__Important:__ By activating SAML, you are transferring your personal account to a company account. **This action is non-reversible**. The following changes will occur:
* **Your API keys will be deleted**
* You will no longer be able to create new API keys
* Ownership of your fleets and devices will be transferred to your company
* Your company can revoke your access at any time
* You will no longer be able to log in using `username` and `password`

You will still be subject to balenaCloud's [**Terms of Service**](https://www.balena.io/terms-of-service) and [**Master Service Agreement**](https://www.balena.io/master-agreement), with the following changes:

* Transfer of Responsibility: The ownership and management of your account will be transferred from you, as an individual user, to the designated company. This means that all rights and obligations under the Terms of Service and the Master Service Agreement will now be governed by the company.
* Legal Entity: The company will become the legal entity responsible for the account. All contractual obligations, liabilities, and benefits associated with the account will be transferred to the company.
* Terms and Conditions: The terms and conditions that apply to your account will remain the same. However, the company will now be responsible for ensuring compliance with these terms.
* Data and Privacy: Your personal data associated with the account will be transferred to the company. The company will be responsible for the protection and use of your data in accordance with the existing privacy policy.

### Log in with a SAML account

Once you have enabled SAML on your account, you can log in using the Enterprise SSO login button or the login URL provided by your balenaCloud organization administrator, e.g., `https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/saml/acme`.

<!-- TODO: Update to latest screenshot -->
<img alt="Login page with Enterprise SSO login highlighted." src="/img/common/saml/login-page.webp" width="60%">

Once you have enabled SAML, you can no longer log in using a `username` and `password` combination and you must always use the SSO login method.

## FAQs

#### How do I set up an Identity Provider?
Each SAML Identity Provider (IdP) has its own unique implementation and terminology, which can result in variations in the configuration process. While it is not feasible to provide detailed configuration guidelines for every IdP, we have included example guides for two of the major providers: [Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)][ms-saml] and [Google Workspace SAML](/learn/accounts/idp-setup/google-workspace-saml-setup/). These examples are designed to help you understand the necessary steps and how to configure your own provider effectively.

#### Can I use any identity provider with balena’s Enterprise SSO?

We support any identity provider as long as they are compliant with the SAML 2.0 protocol specification, for example, Okta. We have provided examples for [Microsoft Entra ID][ms-saml] (formerly Azure AD) and [Google Workspace][google-saml] in our documentation. To setup your IdP, get the Federation Metadata XML as we have setup for Microsoft/Google IdP's and then follow the [instructions to link that IdP](https://docs.balena.io/learn/accounts/enterprise-sso/#link-a-saml-identity-provider) to balenaCloud's SSO.

#### Can I enforce SAML on all users in my organization?
It is not yet possible to enforce SAML authentication across your entire organization, but this is a feature we plan to add in the near future.

#### How can I use API keys if SAML users can't create them?
Currently, SAML authentication users cannot create API keys. If you require API keys for automated processes, we suggest creating a new non-SAML account to act as a "service" account. We plan to add the ability to create fleet and organization-level API keys as a follow-up feature to address this limitation.

<!-- NOTE: we link to this FAQ in the dashboard -->
#### How do I delete a SAML account?
To delete a SAML account, you need to use the [balena SDK](https://docs.balena.io/reference/sdk/node-sdk/). This step is only required if you intend to [delete your IdP](#how-do-i-delete-an-identity-provider-in-balenacloud). **Removing the user from your IdP will block their access to balenaCloud**, but their current session will remain active for up to 12 hours after their last login.

__Warning:__ Ensure that there is at least one non-SAML admin user in your organization before deleting all SAML users in the Identity Providers (IdPs). Failure to do so may result in being locked out of your organization.

If you really want to delete your SAML users, execute the following command: 
```JS
await sdk.pine.delete({
    resource: 'saml_account',
    options: {
        $filter: {
            remote_id: '<USER_EMAIL_GOES_HERE>'
        }
    }
})
```
**Important:** This action is irreversible and the account cannot be recovered once deleted.

#### How do I delete an Identity Provider in balenaCloud?
An IdP can only be removed once all associated SAML accounts are removed from the organizations connected to the IdP.

#### Why do I get an error when enabling 2FA on my SAML account?
If you continually get an error when trying to enable 2FA on your SAML user account, it is recommended to log out, re-login, and immediately try to enable 2FA again.

# Fleet members

BalenaCloud offers the ability to collaborate with other users on the platform by inviting members to your fleets, apps or blocks and assigning them a varying degree of access as per your requirement using Member types. To invite members to your organization, refer to [organization management][organization-management].   

When a fleet needs to be shared with more than one user, the fleet owner can add new members. With paid accounts, it's possible to assign a level of access for a new member, based on the following types:

### Member types

| Member Type   | [Add members][administrator]   | Delete App  | Add/Remove device  | Manage provisioning keys  | [Device specific actions][device-actions]  | [Tags][tags] | [Variables][variables] | [SSH access][ssh] | [Push][deploy] | [Configuration][configuration] | [Fleet specific actions][fleet-actions] |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:| ----:|
| Administrator | Yes      | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Developer     | No       | No   | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Operator      | No       | No   | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes | Yes | No  | No  | No  |
| Observer      | No       | No   | No   | No   | No   | No   | No  | No  | No  | No  | No  |

#### Administrator

A new fleet in balenaCloud can only be created by an [administrator][administrator] of an organization. Administrators are the only users who can add other fleet members or delete the fleet. Learn more about the [administrator role][administrator] in an organization.

#### Observer

Observers are given read-only access to the fleet and its devices. They are not able to modify, add, or remove any devices, nor are they able to perform device actions. This role can only be assigned by fleet owners on paid plans.

#### Operator

Operators have all the access given to observers, plus the ability to manage a fleet's devices. This means operators can add and remove devices, generate & revoke provisioning API keys, perform device actions, and modify device tags, metadata, and environment variables. Operators also have full [SSH access][ssh] to the fleet's devices. This role can only be assigned by fleet owners on paid plans.

#### Developer

Developers are given, in addition to the access provided to operators, the ability to manage fleet software. This includes creating new releases, modifying fleet variables, and downloading balenaOS images. This role is the closest to a fleet owner—developers can do everything owners can except for deleting the fleet or adding new members. The Developer role can be assigned by fleet owners on free or paid accounts.

### Add a fleet member

To add a new member to your fleet, click on the *Members* tab of the fleet:

<img alt="Members Tab" src="/img/common/app/members_tab.webp" width="15%">

This brings up a list of all fleet members, if any have been assigned. Click on the *Add member* button in the top left:

<img alt="Create Application Member" src="/img/common/app/add_member.webp" width="100%">

The *Add member* dialog has a dropdown with descriptions of the member types, as well as information about which types are available based on your billing plan. Choose a level of access, then enter the username or email address of the new member:

<img alt="Add Application Member" src="/img/common/app/member_dialog.webp" width="60%">

__Note:__ Fleet members must have already [signed up][signup] for a {{ $names.company.lower }} account before they can be added to a fleet.

After you click *Add*, you will see the username of the new member in the list. From here, you can edit access levels or remove the user if necessary:

<img alt="List Application Members" src="/img/common/app/member_list.webp" width="100%">

All users that have been added to a fleet will see that fleet in their dashboard, with an indicator to designate it has been shared by the fleet owner:

<img alt="Shared Application" src="/img/common/app/shared_app.webp" width="40%">

Fleet members will have the option to remove themselves from a fleet by clicking on the members tab, selecting the checkbox by their name from the member list, clicking on the *Modify* button, and selecting *Delete member*.

__Warning:__ If you remove your member access to a fleet, you will not be able to undo the action. Only the fleet owner will be able to restore your access.

# Fleet Types

Microservices fleets are full-featured, allowing you to run [multiple containers][multicontainer] and set up a [public URL][public-url].

__Note:__ As of March 2023, balena has removed the concept of fleet types, effectively enforcing that all future fleets are of type Microservices. There are still customers with essentials, classic, and legacy fleet types so we'll keep the following docs for posterity. While it is possible to provision new devices to existing essentials, legacy, and classic fleets, it is not possible to create new fleets of these types.

## Essentials, Classic, and Legacy (sunset)

Essentials, classic, and legacy fleets allow you to run a single container and do not permit public device URLs. The classic and legacy fleet types allow for fleets that don't meet the requirements for new fleet types. Classic fleets support devices with {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.0.3 and above, and legacy fleets support all earlier {{ $names.os.lower }} versions. Classic fleets use Docker Registry V2, whereas legacy fleets use the slower and less reliable Registry V1. New classic fleets can only be created for device types that do not yet have {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0 or higher available. However, for supported device types, you can convert an essentials, classic, and legacy fleet to a microservices fleet, as described below.

__Note:__ All devices microservice and essentials fleets must run {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0 or higher. If you do not have the option to choose one of these fleet types, the selected device type does not yet have a high enough {{ $names.os.lower }} version available. A classic fleet type will be assigned by default.

## Converting to Microservices

Existing fleets can be converted to Microservices, as long as all devices belonging to that fleet meet the OS version requirements, and the account has appropriate privileges.

To convert your fleet, first be sure all devices meet the {{ $names.os.lower }} version requirements for the desired fleet type, [updating][update] if necessary. Then, from the fleet summary page, click *Settings*, and scroll down to the *Fleet type* section. Select the fleet type you would like to convert to from the dropdown. If your fleet cannot be converted to the selected type, you will see it marked as unavailable.

# Configure a SAML app for Google Workspace

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a SAML Identity Provider (IdP) using Google Workspace to integrate with balenaCloud. At the end of this guide, you can start using Single Sign-On functionality from your IdP in balenaCloud.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a Google Workspace admin account capable of creating apps and users for the organization.

## Steps

1.	Access the Google Admin Console
    * Go to [Google Admin Console Apps](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/unified) using your Google Workspace admin account.

2.	Create a New Custom SAML App
    * Click on Add app.
    * Select Add custom SAML app.

3.	Configure the SAML App
    * Name Your App: Provide a meaningful name for the SAML app (e.g., “balenaCloud SSO”).
    * Download the Metadata: After naming your app, download the metadata file provided by Google. This file will be used later to set up the IdP in balenaCloud.

4.	Set Up Service Provider Details

    * ACS URL: Fill in the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL with:

    ```
    https://api.balena-cloud.com/auth/saml/acme/callback
    ```

    Replace `acme` with the name you will give your IdP in balenaCloud.

    * Entity ID: Fill in the Entity ID with:

    ```
    https://api.balena-cloud.com/auth/saml/acme
    ```

    Again, replace `acme` with the name you will give your IdP.

5.	Skip Attribute Mapping
    * Ignore any mapping configuration. Currently, balenaCloud does not make use of these mappings.

6.	Enable the SAML App
    * In the Service Status section, ensure the new SAML app is set to `ON` for everyone or specific groups. This will those users in your organization access to login to balenaCloud via SSO.

7. Finally, you should a custom SAML app in your Google Workspace that looks similar to this

<img alt="Download XML" src="/img/common/saml/google-workspace-saml-app-final.webp" width="100%">

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You should now have your Identity Provider (IdP) setup, head over to the balenaCloud dashboard and follow the [instructions to link an IdP](/learn/accounts/enterprise-sso/#link-a-saml-identity-provider) by uploading the XML metadata file. Your team can then start using the Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, allowing them to securely and seamlessly access the platform using their enterprise credentials.

title: Organization management
---

# Organization management

In balenaCloud, users manage fleets and collaborate in _organizations_. An organization is a group of members, teams, and fleets that is managed by one or more organization administrators. An organization can have any number of members that can be grouped into teams and granted varying levels of access to its fleets according to their assigned role.

Administrators are implicitly granted the ability to perform any possible action to the organization and its associated resources. Actions include inviting and removing members, managing fleets, teams, and billing of the organization. General members have much more limited administration capabilities and rely on Administrators to place them in teams, grant access to fleets, and more.

Each user can create or be a member of an unlimited number of organizations. A organization is automatically created upon user registration, and the user is assigned as its administrator. This organization is named after the user's balenaCloud username and is managed like any other but *currently cannot be deleted*.

**Note:** Billing applies to each organization separately. Administrators can upgrade an organization at any time to the appropriate billing plan as needed.

## What can you do with organizations?

With organizations, you can:

* Invite users to an organization as members, and group them in teams.
* Manage access control at the team level, associating fleets with teams.
* Grant fleet access to teams or individual members in bulk.
* Granular access control at the fleet level to assign, modify or revoke user roles when needed.

## Creating a new organization

To create a new organization, navigate to your balenaCloud dashboard and click the `Organizations` tab on the sidebar.

<img alt="Organizations tab" src="/img/common/app/organizations_tab.webp">

Next, click the `Create Organization` button to get the create organization modal below. Fill in the name of your organization, and you are all set. This is also the page where you can check all organizations that you have access to. The user creating an organization is, by default, given administrator access to that organization.

<img alt="Organizations tab" src="/img/common/app/create_organization.webp" width="100%">

Only administrators can delete an organization. Alternatively, anyone can leave an organization by clicking the `Leave organization` button on the organization summary page.

## Managing roles & access in an organization

The roles inside the organization give granular control over access & visibility to the user. These roles can be assigned when inviting new members to your organization:

* **Administrator**: Full access to the organization, its fleets, and all devices inside them. Administrators also have access to organization's invoices, payment methods, and subscription plan. Administrators can assign roles for incoming members, group them into teams, and grant application access to those teams with granular control over which roles are being assigned at the fleet level.

* **Member**: Members are granted read-only access to an organization with explicit access to its fleets and teams. Administrators assign roles on the fleet level. Members have no visibility over other fleets and teams that they haven't been assigned access to.

### Inviting members to an organization

With your organization created, let's invite some members. Only the administrator can invite users to an organization. To invite, click the `Manage members` button on the organization summary dashboard. On the page that opens, click the `Invite member` button to open the `Invite organization member` modal. Here, you can either add users with their email address or with their balena username after assigning them roles in your organization. Click `Add member` to invite the user to your organization.

<img alt="Invite Organization Member Modal" src="/img/common/app/invite_org_member.webp">

Depending on the role assigned, they can access and manage both apps and other members inside the organization. To change a member's role, navigate to the `Members` tab in the sidebar. Next, click the checkbox next to the member's name, and then go over to the `Actions` button, click that, and choose `Change membership`. Change the `Organization role` of the desired user using the dropdown list against their username.

<img alt="Change Organization Member Roles" src="/img/common/app/modify_org_roles.webp" width="100%">


## Creating teams in your organization

Organization members can be grouped into teams. Teams provide the means to manage members according to their function effectively. Only administrators can create, modify or delete teams.

To create a team, navigate to the `Teams` page via the sidebar and click the `Create Team` button. In the create team modal, enter the team name being created and click the `Create Team` button.

<img alt="Create Team in Organization" src="/img/common/app/create_team.webp" width="100%">

Once the team is created, add members or grant the team access to fleets by clicking on the `Manage members` and `Manage fleets` buttons, respectively.

<img alt="Organization Team Summary" src="/img/common/app/org_team_summary.webp" width="100%">


## Creating new fleets under your organization

With members invited to the organization, let's get started on creating new fleets under an organization. Navigate to the `fleets` tab in the sidebar (under the correct Organization if you have multiple ones) to find the `Create fleet` button for creating a new fleet under your organization. Learn more about creating a fleet from the [getting started][getting-started] guide.

<img alt="New Application under Organization" src="/img/common/app/create_app_under_org.webp" width="100%">

### Moving existing fleets to an organization

Moving an existing fleet to an organization is a common task accomplished by [transferring ownership][transferring-ownership] of your fleet.

<img alt="Transfer Ownership" src="/img/common/app/transfer_ownership.webp" width="100%">

### Granting access to fleets

Organization administrators can grant access to fleets either directly to individual members or to teams. There are three fleet-level roles that can be assigned, [`Developer`][developer], [`Observer`][observer], and [`Operator`][operator], which grant varying levels of access. Administrators are implicitly granted full access to all fleets of the organization.

- **Granting individual members access to fleets** - Once you are done inviting members, click the username of the member you want to grant access from the `Members` list. On the member's summary page, click `Manage fleets`. From there, click the `Add to fleets` button to add the member to one or more fleets with the desired role.

- **Granting teams access to fleets** - Teams and their members can be granted access to specific fleets from the `Organization Teams` tab.  Click the `Manage fleets` button on the team summary page. From there, click the `Add fleets to team` button to add the team to one or more fleets available under the org with the desired roles. All team members will be granted access to the selected application(s) with the specified role per fleet.

<img alt="Grant Team Access to fleets" src="/img/common/app/application_access_to_team.webp" width="100%">

Alternatively to **remove access** to fleets, for individual members or teams, you can navigate back to the respective summary page of the member or team and click the `Manage fleets` button there. From the fleet list, check the checkboxes for the relevant fleets and click the `Remove access` button at the top of the page.

<img alt="Remove Access to Applications" src="/img/common/app/remove_access_applications.webp" width="100%">

### I've got a fleet. How do I collaborate with others?

To collaborate with other users on a single fleet, you can refer to adding a [fleet member][add-fleet-member] using their email address or username. After adding the user, you will find them in your organization added as a member as well. Members will only have access to those application(s) in the organization that you explicitly grant them access to. You can review each member's access by clicking the member's username in the `Members` list present on the organization summary page. On the page with your view as an administrator, you can check what teams and fleets the member has access to.

excerpt: Enable support access to the entire fleet or individual devices for a set period
---

# Support access

## Accessing your device

Any device owned by you will automatically allow access via either the WebTerminal (in the device's Dashboard page), or the balena CLI via `balena ssh <uuid>`. However, for a support agent to gain access to a device that isn't owned by them, you would need to grant access for it explicitly.

## Granting Support Access to a Support Agent

It is possible to grant support access to a device, all devices in a fleet or to a block to enable support and device troubleshooting by {{ $names.company.lower }} employees.

Access is granted for a set, user-defined period, and access may be revoked at any time. Access for support agents is limited, which includes variables and configurations (both fleet and device), the ability to reboot the device, apply balenaOS upgrades, pin releases, etc. This is not a comprehensive list and may be subject to further changes. 

This ensures that a device under investigation cannot be unnecessarily altered or modified. Support investigations are intended as an avenue of exploration and research for ensuring that issues are categorized to allow improvements to the product surface such that these issues are eliminated.

Once support access has been granted, a support agent will be able to use the UUID of a device to gain access to it. Support access is enabled via SSH over cloudlink, so the device must be online and connected to cloudlink. Alternatively, it may be possible to access a problematic device from a gateway device operating on the same network.

__Note:__ It is possible to disable support access functionality by removing the {{ $names.company.lower }} SSH public key from the device. However, this will render the device inaccessible remotely for the purposes of support and updates to the host OS. For more details see our [security documentation](/learn/welcome/security/#support-access).

### Grant support access for a device

To enable support access for a single device, select the _Actions_ menu in the Device dashboard, and choose the _Grant Support Access_ button and choose the period to grant device access. You may revoke access at any time by selecting _Revoke Support Access_ on the same page.

![Grant support for a device](/img/common/support/enable-support-access-device.webp)

### Grant support access for a fleet

To enable support access for all devices in a fleet, select the _Grant Support Access_ from the _Settings_ menu of the Fleet dashboard, and choose the period to grant access. This may be revoked at any time by selecting _Revoke Support Access_ on the same page.

![Grant support access for a fleet](/img/common/support/enable-support-access-fleet.webp)

### Grant support access for a block

To enable support access for block, select the _Grant Support Access_ from the _Settings_ menu of the block dashboard, and choose the period to grant access. This may be revoked at any time by selecting _Revoke Support Access_ on the same page.

![Grant support access for a block](/img/common/support/enable-support-block.webp)

### Grant support access using the CLI

To grant or revoke support access for devices or fleets, use the `balena support <action>` command. Refer to [CLI Support access](/reference/balena-cli/#support-action) docs for more information. 

## Feeling Stuck?

If you find yourself stuck or confused, help is just a click away:

title: Optimize your builds
excerpt: Tips for reducing the time to build your {{ $names.company.lower }} container builds
---

# Optimize your builds

These are just a few tips and tricks to optimize your {{ $names.company.lower }} container builds and hopefully reduce the time it takes to build and push. They mostly make use of the caching mechanism in the Docker container builders on our servers. If you want to read more about how Docker caches layers and Docker best practices, head over to [Docker best practices][docker-best-practices].

__Note:__ For information on using multi-stage builds to reduce image sizes, see the [services masterclass][services-masterclass].

## Move `ADD` and `COPY` Commands

Caching in Docker is done by comparing the instructions in the current `Dockerfile` with the ones in the previous build. If the instructions have changed, the cache is invalidated. However, this is slightly different for the `ADD` and `COPY` commands. For these commands, the contents of the files being put into the image are examined. If there are any changes, even in the file metadata, then the cache is invalidated. We recommend you place your `ADD` or `COPY` statements near the end of your Dockerfiles, after all your package installs and source compilation steps have been completed.

## Minimize the number of layers

Reducing the number of layers in your Dockerfile can reduce the build and push time on {{ $names.company.lower }}. If we combine two instructions we avoid making another layer so we’re not storing intermediate (and maybe useless) states. Reducing the number of layers can be achieved by chaining multiple commands together with `&&` in `RUN` invocations. e.g. :
```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python
```
However, we recommend you find a balance between readability (and thus long-term maintainability) of the Dockerfile and minimizing the number of layers it uses.

## Avoid installing unnecessary packages
In order to reduce complexity, dependencies, file sizes, and build times, you should avoid installing extra or unnecessary packages just because they might be “nice to have.” For example, you don’t always need to include a text editor.

## Multi-stage builds

{{ $names.company.upper }} supports [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/). When building your application, you might require build-time dependencies, or other files which are not needed at _runtime_. With multi-stage builds, you can use multiple `FROM` statements to describe a new stage. Each stage can use a different base image and you can copy files and artifacts from one stage to another. This allows you to only copy necessary files and tools into the final image you want to ship, keeping it lean. Here is an example illustrating multi-stage build for a `golang` project. 

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24.3-bookworm AS build # define a build stage 

WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/balena-io-projects/app

COPY /app ./

RUN go build

FROM debian:bookworm-20250428-slim # use a different, leaner image in final image

COPY --from=build /go/src/github.com/balena-io-projects/app/ . # copy build artifacts from build stage

CMD ["./app"]
```

{{ $names.company.upper }} base images come in two variants, namely `build` and `run`. Refer to the docs on [the differences between the two variants][run-vs-build].

### Using scratch

Most Dockerfiles start from a parent(base) image. Docker has a [reserved  image][scratch] `scratch` that has no layers and can be used to create lightweight images. Note that there won't be a root filesystem(rootfs) in the scratch image. This typically means you have to _statically_ compile your application if possible or add all dependencies your application needs to run properly. 

## Cleaning up after yourself

We can tidy up a bit by cleaning out the apt-cache and cleaning out tmp:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    git \
    libsqlite3-dev \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

__Note:__ The above command should never be split over two or more `RUN` commands, as the benefits will be lost.

It is also wise to remove any .tar.gz or temporary files in a similar fashion to the above, as this will reduce build size.

## Use .dockerignore

Make use of `.dockerignore` to ignore anything that is in the git repo, but is not strictly needed on the device(s). This can allow you to safely ignore images or assets used to document your project on github or bitbucket.

## Don't do apt-get update or upgrade

This isn't so much of an optimization tip, but more a guideline to ensure maintainable Docker images. Note the below tips were kindly borrowed from [Docker Best Practices][docker-best-practices].

* Don’t do `RUN apt-get update` on a single line. This will cause caching issues if the referenced archive gets updated, which will make your subsequent apt-get install fail without comment.

* Avoid `RUN apt-get upgrade` or `dist-upgrade`, since many of the “essential” packages from the base images will fail to upgrade inside an unprivileged container. If a base package is out of date, you should contact its maintainers. If you know there’s a particular package, foo, that needs to be updated, use apt-get install -y foo and it will update automatically.

## Starting long running tasks together
If you have commands that do not depend on each other, they can be started in the background at the same time to decrease build time. An example of this could be two downloads of unrelated sources:

```
RUN wget my-source-1.tar.gz & \
    && wget my-source-2.tar.gz & \
    && wait
```

This will start downloading both files and wait for them to complete. The next layer could then start the build on one or both of them.

## Pro Tips for slimming down your build

These are just a few tips from our engineers on how to reduce your build size:

* npm install commands like `npm install --unsafe-perm -g @some/node-module` can have `&& npm cache clean --force && rm -rf /tmp/*` added in order to clean up the npm cache and the /tmp/npm-... folders it uses.

* apt-get update commands should have a matching `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists` in order to clean up the package lists (or `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/*` which is equivalent).

* You can combine the smaller layers together (each RUN/COPY/etc command creates a new layer) in order to reduce the metadata required for each layer and to speed up the updating process (each layer is downloaded individually), eg. you could change:
```Dockerfile
RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
RUN echo 'root:{{ $names.os.short }}' | chpasswd
RUN sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin without-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
into
```Dockerfile
RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd \
  && echo 'root:{{ $names.os.short }}' | chpasswd
  && sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin without-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
In order to merge those three layers into just one, without losing any benefits of Docker caching, this would also work well for combing the layers that add the apt mirrors.

* You can potentially add `--no-install-recommends` in your apt-get installs in order to only install the packages you really care about, rather than all the recommended but non-essential packages.

You can exclude `docs/locales` since they're not much use on the device, we do this via the command `COPY 01_nodoc /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/` which has the contents:

```
path-exclude /usr/share/doc/*
path-exclude /usr/share/man/*
path-exclude /usr/share/groff/*
path-exclude /usr/share/info/*
path-exclude /usr/share/lintian/*
path-exclude /usr/share/linda/*

path-exclude /usr/share/locale/*
path-include /usr/share/locale/en*
```

title: Delta updates
excerpt: How binary delta updates work on {{ $names.company.lower }}, and how to enable it for your fleets
---

# Delta updates

When a new release is successfully created, your devices are notified, and will initiate an update of their running containers. The regular device update uses the Docker pull mechanism. It requests all the [layers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/drivers/#images-and-layers) of the new container image that are not present on the device (i.e. not shared with the previous image). Then from these layers the new image is assembled on the device, and replaces the previous version of the fleet services. This process potentially moves a lot of data, uses a lot of space on the device to hold both the old and the new images, and the device can be in a sensitive state while Docker is updating (e.g. in case there's an unexpected power outage during that time).

To address some of these issues, we have implemented a "binary delta" update process. Instead of initiating a Docker pull when the device is notified about an update, it requests the {{ $names.company.lower }} servers to provide just the differences between the old and new container image. This comparison is done on the full image level, comparing the actual content, regardless of the layers used, resulting in the minimum amount of change required to get from the previous release to the new one. In the worst case (i.e. completely replaced image) the binary delta is equal size to the Docker pull (the device needs to download the full image). In most cases, the binary delta will be much smaller.

Once the delta (difference between the old and new image) is calculated, the device downloads and applies this delta onto the old image, in place. When the process is finished, the new container image (new release) is started.

These binary deltas save on the amount of data needed to be downloaded, reduce the storage space requirements on the device to perform an update, and shorten the time taken for the update to apply.

## Enabling delta updates

The delta updates feature is now available in all devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} >= 2.47.1. For devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} < 2.47.1, updating to >= 2.47.1 via a [self-service update][self-service-update] will enable delta updates for your device.

## Delta behavior

Before devices can update using deltas, a delta must be generated between the release a device is currently running and the one it is updating to. There are two ways deltas are generated:

1. Automatically between the last successful and the new release during a build on the {{$names.cloud.lower}} builder - these are known as "build-time" deltas.
2. Automatically when a device is requesting to update from or to a release for which no delta has been generated before - these are known as "on-demand" deltas and can typically happen if the device was not on the latest release when the new release was pushed, or the user did not use the {{$names.cloud.lower}} builder for the new release.

On-demand deltas may take a while to generate, depending primarily on the size of the images involved. While the delta is generating, the device keeps polling the API, checking if the delta is ready. If a delta already exists, this step is skipped.

The *Download progress* bar on the dashboard might show for only a short time, much shorter than in a normal update. In the most common development patterns, there are usually very small changes between one version of the image and the next (e.g. fixing typos, adding a new source file, or installing an extra OS package), so when using deltas these changes are downloaded much quicker than before.

Devices using delta updates still follow the prescribed [update strategy][update-strategies].

title: Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }} button
excerpt: The Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }} button allows users to do a single-click deployment and configuration of a fleet on {{ $names.cloud.lower }}
---

# Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }} button

The **Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}** button allows users to perform a single-click deployment and configuration of a fleet on {{ $names.cloud.lower }}.

![Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)

Clicking the **Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}** button opens the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard with a modal window pre-populated with everything required to deploy a fleet. Clicking the _Advanced_ toggle in the modal window allows adding additional configuration options. If the project has provided configuration variables via a [configuration file](#balenayml-configuration-file), then they are pre-populated in this section.

<img src="/img/configuration/deploy-to-balena.webp" width="80%">

Clicking _Create and deploy_ creates a new fleet and generates a release. Any devices added to the fleet will immediately download and begin running the release.

**Note:** Currently git submodules are not supported and will not build properly.

## Adding a deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }} button to a project

You can add the **Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}** button to any project that can be deployed to {{ $names.cloud.lower }}. To add the button to a project repository, add the following to, for example, the project repository's README.md file:

`[![balena deploy button](https://www.balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=<your-repo-url>)`

The above example uses a SVG logo as this renders better on GitHub - however, you can also use the PNG version by changing the file ending `.svg` to `.png`. Note that you can further customize the button's behavior through the use of [query string parameters](#query-string-parameters).

### Query string parameters

You can further customize the behavior of the **Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}** button by providing additional URL parameters. The following URL parameters are available and may be appended to the `https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy` link:

- `repoUrl` - The URL of the project repository. If you are placing the deploy button in a GitHub repo then {{ $names.cloud.lower }} can auto-determine the `repoUrl` from the referrer info in the HTTP headers. However on Firefox and with some ad-blockers this may fail. We recommend that you populate this query string parameter.
- `tarballUrl` - The URL of the project tarball. Automatically determined from `repoUrl` if not provided.
- `configUrl` - The URL of the configuration file for the fleet. Automatically determined from `repoUrl` if not provided.
- `defaultDeviceType` - The device type that will be pre-selected in the "Create fleet" modal. It defaults to Raspberry Pi 4 if not provided. You can find a list of [device types here](/reference/hardware/devices/).

### balena.yml configuration file

Through the use of a `balena.yml` config file, you may also specify [configuration](/learn/manage/configuration/) defaults and provide [variables](/learn/manage/variables/). If provided, these are pre-populated in the advanced modal dialog when using the **Deploy with {{ $names.company.lower }}** button.

The `balena.yml` file can also be used to provide additional metadata to be used if the app is submitted to [balenaHub][balenahub].

The file should be named `balena.yml` and be located in the root of the project repository, or the `configUrl` link must be specified. A full example of the `balena.yml` file is shown below:

```yaml
name: balenaSound
type: sw.application
version: 3.5.2
description: >-
  Build a single or multi-room streamer for an existing audio device using a
  Raspberry Pi! Supports Bluetooth, Airplay and Spotify Connect
assets:
  repository:
    type: blob.asset
    data:
      url: 'https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound'
  logo:
    type: blob.asset
    data:
      url: >-
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/master/logo.png
data:
  applicationEnvironmentVariables:
    - SOUND_VOLUME: 75
    - AUDIO_OUTPUT: AUTO

    - raspberry-pi
    - raspberry-pi2
    - raspberrypi3
    - raspberrypi4-64
    - fincm3
    - intel-nuc
```

- `type` - Required field. In most cases this would be `sw.application`, unless you are implementing a block, in which case you need to use `sw.block`. For reference, check [balena.yml file for a block][create-your-block]. 
- `name` - A user-friendly name of your fleet.
- `description`: A description of what the fleet does. This is what is displayed if the fleet is published on [balenaHub][balenahub].
- `assets`
  - `<asset-slug>`: Supported values are `repository` and `logo`. The size of logo needs to be size 512 x 512 px
    - `type`: A fixed value that should be set to 'blob.asset'
    - `data`:
      - `url` - The URL of the asset that is being uploaded.
- `data`
  - `applicationEnvironmentVariables` - [Variables][variables] allow you to provide runtime configuration without having to modify your source code.
  - `applicationConfigVariables` - [Configuration variables][configuration] allow you to provide runtime configuration to the host OS and supervisor. These variables all begin with `BALENA_` or `RESIN_`.
  - `defaultDeviceType` - The device type that will be pre-selected in the "Create fleet" modal. It defaults to Raspberry Pi 4 if not provided. You can find a list of [device types](/reference/hardware/devices/) here.
  - `supportedDeviceType` - The device types that the fleet supports. You can find a list of [device types](/reference/hardware/devices/) here.
- `version` - A user-defined [semver version](https://semver.org/) for the release that is
  shown in the Version column of the Releases page of the balenaCloud web dashboard, and
  which may also be queried through the balena API `release.semver` field. If multiple
  deployments are made with the same version value, the balena API automatically increases
  the revision number in the format "1.2.3+rev1", "1.2.3+rev2", "1.2.3+rev3" and so on.
  Using version values that are **not** [semver compliant](https://semver.org/) is deprecated
  and may cause deployments to fail in the future. Currently, a deployment may succeed
  with such a non-compliant version value as long as the value is unique across all releases
  in the fleet, however the web dashboard will display version `0.0.0`.

title: Deploy to your fleet
excerpt: The process for deploying to your {{$names.cloud.lower}} managed fleet
---

# Deploy to your Fleet

On {{$names.cloud.lower}}, when we deploy code to devices grouped in a fleet, they all run what we refer to as a "release". A release consists of a Docker image or set of images on our registry. These images are built from a source code repository, either locally or remotely on the [{{$names.cloud.lower}} build server](#the-balenacloud-build-server). When a successful release is created, all devices in the fleet are instructed to download and run the new release (according to the chosen [update strategy][update-strategy]).

There are 3 ways to create and deploy a release, namely [{{$names.company.lower}} push](#balena-push), [{{$names.company.lower}} deploy](#balena-build--deploy) and [git push](#git-push). Each method has slightly different use cases and differ on how and where the container images are built. We'll explain each of the options in more detail below. If you are just starting out with {{$names.cloud.lower}}, we recommend using [{{$names.company.lower}} push](#balena-push).

To get started with the {{$names.company.lower}} CLI, check out our [{{$names.company.lower}} CLI masterclass][cli-masterclass]

## {{$names.company.upper}} Push

### Overview

`{{$names.company.lower}} push` is the recommended method for deployment and [development][local-mode] on the {{$names.cloud.lower}} platform. To use `{{$names.company.lower}} push` you need to first [install the {{$names.company.lower}} CLI][cli] and ensure you are logged in to your account with `{{$names.company.lower}} login`.

When you run the  `{{$names.company.lower}} push <APP_NAME or DEVICE_IP>` command from your laptop it will essentially take your project (or repository) folder, compress it and send it to the [{{$names.cloud.lower}} build server](#the-balenacloud-build-server) or local {{$names.os.lower}} device in [localMode][local-mode] where it will be built.

![How {{$names.company.lower}} push works](/img/common/deployment/balena-push.webp)

Once the cloud builder has successfully completed building all the images in the deployment, it will upload these images to the {{$names.cloud.lower}} registry and create a release entry in the [{{$names.company.lower}} API][api] database. It will then notify all the devices in the fleet that a new release is available. If you need to pull in proprietary code or use a private base image during your builds, you can do so using the [build time secrets](#build-time-secrets-and-variables) or [private base images](#private-base-images) feature of `{{$names.company.lower}} push`.

It should be noted that `{{$names.company.lower}} push` is independent of git, so you are free to use any version control system you wish. This also means that it is possible to use [git submodules][git-submodules] in your project when deploying with `{{$names.company.lower}} push`.

__Note:__ Refer to the [`{{$names.company.lower}} push` command reference][cli-push-reference] for additional documentation.

## {{$names.company.upper}} Build & Deploy

### Overview

The `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` is functionally very similar to [{{$names.company.lower}} push](#balena-push) but avoids pushing any source code to the [{{$names.cloud.lower}} build server](#the-balenacloud-build-server). It gives more control over how and where your container images are built, allowing for `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` to be integrated into your own [CI/CD][continuous-deployment] build system.

![How {{$names.company.lower}} deploy works](/img/common/deployment/balena-deploy.webp)

With `{{$names.company.lower}} build` container images are built on your development machine or on a remote machine, by specifying a docker daemon's IP address and port number with the relevant command-line options (for example a device running a {{$names.os.lower}} [development image][development-image]). Depending on your fleet's targeted CPU architecture builds will be run emulated via [qemu][qemu].

If you are building your own container images, `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` will upload the images to the {{$names.cloud.lower}} image registry and then create a release entry in the [{{$names.company.lower}} API][api] database. The devices in the fleet will then be notified of a new release and download it. Should `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` not find the required images on the specified docker daemon, it will automatically trigger a build.

Like `{{$names.company.lower}} push` it is also independent of git, and you can use any version control system you wish. It is also possible to use [private base images](#private-base-images).

__Note:__ Refer to the [`{{$names.company.lower}} build`][[cli-build-reference]] and [`{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` command reference][[cli-deploy-reference]] for additional documentation.

## Git Push

### Overview

The `git push {{$names.company.lower}} master` method of deployment is the original deployment mechanism for {{$names.cloud.lower}}. While we continue to support git push, it is considered a legacy method for pushing code to a fleet, and if possible you should use [{{$names.company.lower}} push](#balena-push) as it makes for a consistent workflow and methodology.

The `git push` workflow requires that you have [git][git] installed on your development machine and that you have an SSH key [setup on your {{$names.cloud.lower}} account][add-ssh-key].

![how git push works](/img/common/deployment/git-push.webp)

Then, simply add your {{$names.cloud.lower}} app's git endpoint to your local git repository via `git remote add {{$names.company.lower}} <fleet git endpoint>` . You can find the fleet git remote endpoint by clicking the 'Add release' button in the releases tab of the dashboard.

![Where to find git remote](/img/common/deployment/git-remote.webp)

Whenever you subsequently need to push code to your devices, simply run
`git push {{$names.company.lower}} master`.

__Warning:__ The {{$names.cloud.lower}} git repository **is not** intended as a code hosting solution, and we cannot guarantee the persistence of data in {{$names.cloud.lower}} git remotes. We recommend you use a service like [GitHub][github] to manage and share your code.

If you want to push a different local git branch to your {{$names.company.lower}} fleet all you need to do is:
`git push {{$names.company.lower}} my-local-branch:master`

### Switching Between Apps

To completely change the code you have pushed to a fleet with `git` you will need to force a rewrite of the git remote endpoint's history. To do this, you just need to run the same command with the `-f` flag from the new project you wish to deploy. For example:

```shell
$ cd project/my-new-project
$ git push {{$names.company.lower}} master -f
```

### Limitations

The `git push` workflow is a great way to deploy code, but it has a number of limitations when compared to `{{$names.company.lower}} push` and `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy`. One is mentioned above, where it is necessary to rewrite the history and force push to completely change the source code and build a new release from scratch.

Another is that it's not possible to use the [build time secrets](#build-time-secrets-and-variables) or [private base images](#private-base-images) without having to commit your secrets into your code repository.

In order to allow options like emulation and nocache, the `git push` workflow uses specifically named remote branches (see next section) however, this has the limitation that it is not possible to invalidate the cache of an emulated build pushed with `git push`.

### Additional Options

Like `{{$names.company.lower}} push` the `git push` workflow also allows triggering a build that invalidates the Docker layer cache and builds from scratch. This can be achieved by pushing to a special branch called `{{$names.company.lower}}-nocache` as shown in the example below:

```shell
$ git push {{$names.company.lower}} master:{{$names.company.lower}}-nocache
```

Similarly you can also trigger a [qemu][qemu] build on the [{{$names.cloud.lower}}](#the-balenacloud-build-server) build server by pushing to the `{{$names.company.lower}}-emulated` remote branch as shown below:

```shell
$ git push {{$names.company.lower}} master:{{$names.company.lower}}-emulated
```

## Project Structure

When deploying a {{$names.company.lower}} project, the build system will try to build the most appropriate release for a specific set of devices. The following section will discuss some of the mechanisms you can use to control the type of builds that are produced.

### Project Resolutions

All the deployment methods will always try to determine the project type based on the following project resolution ordering:

- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile.\<device-type\>
- Dockerfile.\<arch\>
- Dockerfile.template
- Dockerfile
- package.json

This resolution mechanism looks at the files in the root of the directory you are deploying. If it finds a `docker-compose.yml` file, it will ignore all the other types and build a multicontainer release based on the service specification in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

If `docker-compose.yml` is not specified, the resolution system will assume a single container deployment and will build based on a `Dockerfile.*` file. These Dockerfiles can have extensions of `.<device-type>`, `.<arch>` or `.template`, and the build system will use the most appropriate file based on the targeted device or fleet. This is best described with an example:

In our example at the root of our project repo we have the following `Dockerfile.*` files:

```shell
project: $ tree -a
.
├── Dockerfile.raspberrypi3
├── Dockerfile.i386
└── Dockerfile
```

When we push this project to a fleet that has its default device type set to `Raspberry Pi 3`, the build system will use the device type specific `Dockerfile.raspberrypi3` file to build from. If we instead pushed this to an `Intel NUC` fleet, the build would use the `Dockerfile.amd64` file. When pushing to any other device type, the regular `Dockerfile` would be used to perform the build. This type of project selection will also work in service folders of multicontainer deployments; you can see an example of that in our [Getting started with multicontainer project][multicontainer-project].

The file extensions are equivalent to `{{$names.company.allCaps}}_MACHINE_NAME` for `.<device-type>` and `{{$names.company.allCaps}}_ARCH` for `.<arch>` from the template files discussed in the next section. To find the correct name have a look at our [machine names and architectures list][device-types].

### Template Files

Often it's desirable to create a single Dockerfile that can be used and built for multiple different device types and CPU architectures. In this case, a `Dockerfile.template` file can be used. This [dockerfile template][template-dockerfile] will replace the template variables before the build is started. Currently the builder supports the following build variables:

{{> "deployment/build-variables" }}

You can find the values of `%%{{$names.company.allCaps}}_ARCH%%` and `%%{{$names.company.allCaps}}_MACHINE_NAME%%` for a specific device type [here][device-types].

## Private Base Images

In many cases, you will want to deploy container images from a private Docker Hub account or a personally hosted registry. In order to do this, you need to enable `{{$names.company.lower}}` to authenticate with the private registry during the build, which is done by passing the `--registry-secrets` option with a path to the authentication secrets. An example is shown below:

For `{{$names.company.lower}} push`:

```shell
$ {{$names.company.lower}} push myFleet --registry-secrets ../registry-secrets.yml
```

Or for `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy`:

```shell
$ {{$names.company.lower}} deploy myFleet --registry-secrets ../registry-secrets.yml
```

and the `registry-secrets.yml` file is outside of the code repository and has the following format:

```yaml
'':  # Use the empty string to refer to the Docker Hub
    username: {{$names.company.lower}}
    password: secretpassword
'my-registry-server.com:25000':
    username: myregistryuser
    password: secretpassword
'eu.gcr.io':  # Google Container Registry
    username: '_json_key'
    password: '{escaped contents of the GCR keyfile.json file}'
'ghcr.io':  # GitHub Container Registry
    username: GITHUB_USERNAME
    password: PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

It should be noted that in this case, the devices will still pull the container images from the {{$names.cloud.lower}} registry. The authentication just allows the build step access to pull your private image at build time.

## Build Time Secrets and Variables

Often it is necessary to use passwords or secrets during your build to fetch proprietary files or code but not have these sensitive files be downloaded to all the devices. For this reason `{{$names.company.lower}} push` and `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` allow defining a `.{{$names.company.lower}}` folder to hold secret files and variables that will get exposed to the image build but not propagate down to devices.

{{import "deployment/secrets"}}

## The {{$names.cloud.lower}} build server

The build server is a powerful tool that compiles code specifically for your device's architecture. With our build servers, compiling a complex dependency tree can be done in seconds, as compared to the minutes or even hours it may take to build on your device.

All code that is pushed using `{{$names.company.lower}} push <MY_FLEET>` or `git push` to your {{$names.cloud.lower}} devices is sent to a build server, and then, after the release is built, it is deployed to your devices.

The build server consists of a central build server and a number of Docker daemons on build workers. When a build is triggered, the builder first determines the CPU architecture of the fleet's default device type, and based on that determines what build worker will be used for the build. For [ARM][arm] device types, there are build workers with `armv6l`, `armv7l`, and `armv8l` architectures. For [amd64][amd64] based devices, native `x86_64` build workers are used. Finally the `armv5e` and `i386` architecture device types are always built using emulation.

In the case where the `--emulated` flag is used, the build is built on an `x86_64` machine with qemu emulation to match the CPU architecture of the fleet's default device type.

If you push a project with only a `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.template`, or `package.json` file, a single container image will be built and deployed to your device. The single container will show up on the device dashboard as a service with the name `main`.

For [multicontainer][multicontainer] fleets (Microservices [fleet types][app-types]), a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project directory will start multiple simultaneous image builds, each with their own [build logs](#release-logs).

## View Past Deployments

All successful deployments will result in a release being added to {{$names.cloud.lower}}. These releases are tracked in their own dashboard page accessed via the fleet:

![Release list](/img/common/app/release_list.webp)

The releases page includes a list of all attempted and deployed releases, with information on the status of the release, when it was completed, how long it took, and how many devices are on that particular release. Clicking any row will open up a summary page specifically for that release, with windows showing the `docker-compose.yml` file and Build Logs:

![Release summary](/img/common/app/release_summary.webp)

Much like with the device list, [filters][filters] can be added to the release list by clicking *Add filter* and filling in the appropriate fields:

<img alt="Add release filter" src="/img/common/app/release_filter.webp" width="80%">

[Saved views][saved-views] can also be created to return to a specific collection of filters.

title: Offline updates
excerpt: An efficient approach for updating previously deployed IoT devices when they're offline by design.
---

# Offline Updates

Offline updates is a process to update devices without needing an internet connection. It involves preloading an image and reflashing it to on a device in a way that it retains its unique balena identity, releases, and configurations. This process helps in scenarios where a device's internet access is unavailable, limited, blocked, or even when it's air-gapped.

## Overview of the process

When a device is reflashed, it defaults back to a factory state. The device is provisioned with a new identity, a new API key, and updated [`config.json`][config-file] settings. All services, data and logs stored on the device are erased permanently.

With the offline updates process, the device still resets to a default factory state. It adds a new API key while preserving its identity in [`config.json`][config-file]. It uses [`balena preload`][balena-preload] to load an updated release. That way, the device will pick up right where it left off with the same name and UUID but with an updated release or/and balenaOS update.

Broad steps of the process include:

1. Downloading appropriate balenaOS version (can be an upgrade or the same version).
2. Generating a device-specific `config.json` file for the device.
3. Inserting the custom `config.json` file into the downloaded balenaOS image.
4. Running `balena preload` on the image, pointing to whichever version of your code you want to deploy to the device.
5. Flashing this preloaded image to an SD card, a device's eMMC or a separate (flasher) USB drive.
6. Updating device state on balenaCloud and optionally tagging the device.

When you insert the SD card or USB drive into your device and boot it, the device will be reflashed, retaining its balena identity, and all your updates will be in place and running.

## Configuration and Data Recovery

Some consideration is required if an application requiring persistent data storage is being used to recover user data while using the offline update process. The application can't use the pre-provisioned [named volumes][named-volumes], since these will be wiped during the offline update process.

If this is the case, mount an external mass storage (USB) device into a privileged data container and share it with other containers (if applicable) via NFS or a similar network storage protocol for the data. These external storage devices are not a part of the update process. Hence, data on them would be left intact, as long as they are temporarily disconnected during the update process.

By contrast, a typical balena online update leaves services and data intact, and [persistent logging][persistent-logging] can be enabled to save your logs across device restarts.

## Performing an Offline Update

To perform an offline update, we will be using [balena-cli][balena-cli]. All commands should work on Linux distributions running Docker on Linux Kernel with AUFS and overlay filesystem support. For Windows and macOS, the last version of Docker Desktop supporting AUFS is 18.06.1

> Note: In an offline updates process, all data on the device is wiped at this point, making this different from a typical software update process in the balena ecosystem. Any additional user data and system settings written to various device partitions would be lost in this process.

Offline update includes the following steps:

- [Setup](#setup)
- [Create/use pre-existing fleet](#createuse-pre-existing-fleet)
- [Create/use pre-existing offline device](#createuse-pre-existing-offline-device)
- [Download balenaOS image](#download-balenaos-image)
- [Configure balenaOS image](#configure-balenaos-image)
- [Create and preload release](#create-and-preload-release)
- [Create update media](#create-update-media)
- [Process of reprovisioning](#process-of-reprovisioning)
- [Update device registration(s)](#update-device-registrations)

The process needs some prerequisite knowledge of the balena ecosystem, [balena-cli][balena-cli] commands and shell commands. Please read all instructions carefully and make sure to try the update process first on a test device.

### Setup

> Download and install [balena-cli][balena-cli] on a Linux distribution. The commands have been tested to work on Ubuntu 20.04.

Several `balena-cli` commands require access to a balenaCloud account. Those commands require creating a CLI login session by running [`balena login`](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/#logging-in) in the terminal.

```bash
$ balena login
```

Store the filename of your OpenSSH private key in an environment variable or generate an SSH key using the commands below. The SSH keys will be added to the device and used to SSH into the device after provisioning to help in debugging if needed.

```bash
# (optional) if you already have SSH key(s)
$ ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f id_ed25519 -C 'offline-updates' -N ''

# must contain the filename of the OpenSSH private key
$ ssh_key=id_ed25519.pub
```

### Create/Use Pre-existing Fleet

Initialize the `arch` and `device-type` environment variable with correct CPU architecture (`aarch64`, `armv7l`, etc.) and device type (`raspberrypi4-64`, `raspberrypi3`, etc.). The list of names for supported device types and their architectures can be found on the [hardware][supported-devices-list] page.

If a pre-existing fleet needs to be re-used, then initialize the `fleet_name` variable with that fleet's's name.

```bash
$ arch=<CPU ARCHITECTURE TYPE>
$ device_type=<DEVICE_TYPE>
$ fleet_name=offline-${arch}
```

These environment variables will be used later in the process. If a pre-existing fleet needs to be used, then the next step can be skipped. Otherwise, create a new balenaCloud fleet by running [`balena fleet create`](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/#fleet-create-name).

```bash
$ balena fleet create ${fleet_name} --type ${device_type}
```

Initialize the `fleet_slug` environment variable with the command below to store the slug of the fleet.

```bash
$ fleet_slug=$(balena fleet ${fleet_name} | grep Slug | awk '{print $3}')
```

### Create/Use Pre-existing Offline Device

If a new offline device is being created, then the following command can be used. Otherwise, the `uuid` environment variable can be initialized with the UUID of a pre-existing device that needs to be updated.

```bash
$ uuid=$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/-//g')
```
OR
```
$ uuid=<UUID OF YOUR DEVICE>
```

With [`balena device register`][balena-device-register], devices can be preregistered to a balenaCloud fleet involving a simple call with a unique identifier for the device. You can read more about the full process of pre-registering a device in the [balena-cli advanced masterclass][balena-cli advanced masterclass]. This step can be skipped if a pre-existing device is needed to be updated.

```bash
$ balena device register ${fleet_slug} --uuid ${uuid}
```

### Download balenaOS Image

Download the latest production version of [balenaOS][balenaos] for the device type initialized in the `device_type` version.

```bash
$ os_version=$(balena os versions ${device_type} | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}')
$ tmpimg=$(mktemp).img

$ balena os download ${device_type} \
  --output ${tmpimg} \
  --version ${os_version}
```

### Configure balenaOS Image

Configure the downloaded image by injecting a [config.json][config-file] file using the [`balena os configure`][balena-os-configure] command. Most common system settings can be (re)specified via [config.json][config-file]. To preserve the pre-existing registered device's identity, the same `uuid` initialized earlier will be used to generate a config.json file.

```bash
$ tmpconfig=$(mktemp)
$ config=$(mktemp)

$ balena config generate \
    --device ${uuid} \
    --version ${os_version} \
    --network ethernet \
    --appUpdatePollInterval 10 \
    --output ${tmpconfig} \
    && cat ${tmpconfig} | jq .

$ cat < ${tmpconfig} \
    | jq --arg keys "$(cat ${ssh_key})" '. + {os: {sshKeys: [$keys]}}' > "${config}" \
    && cat < ${config} | jq .

$ balena os configure ${tmpimg} \
    --fleet ${fleet_slug} \
    --device-type ${device_type} \
    --version ${os_version} \
    --config-network ethernet \
    --config ${config}

$ rm ${tmpconfig}
$ rm ${config}
```

### Create and Preload Release

Offline updates revolve around the concept of [balena preload][balena-preload]. Preload is used to flash the balenaOS image and your fleet release in a single step, so the device starts running your release's containers as soon as it boots. Preloading removes the need for your devices to download the initial images directly from balena's build servers, making it an ideal base for the offline update process. Read more about [preloading a device image][preloading-device-image].

> Important note: [balena preload](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL-MAC.md#balena-preload) functionality requires Docker with AUFS support.

Preload involves flashing a fleet's release with the balenaOS image. If the pre-existing fleet doesn't have any releases, then a release needs to be created using [`balena deploy`][balena-deploy]. Navigate to the directory of your source code folder and run the command below to deploy the latest release of your fleet. If a release is present already, then the next step can be skipped.

```bash
$ balena deploy ${fleet_slug} --build --emulated --source .
```

The following steps will flash the latest release onto the balenaOS image downloaded in the previous steps and pin the device to mentioned release commit.

```bash
$ commit=$(balena fleet ${fleet_slug} | grep Commit | awk '{print $3}')

$ balena preload ${tmpimg} \
    --fleet ${fleet_slug} \
    --commit ${commit} \
    --pin-device-to-release
```

### Create Update Media

Next, a USB flash drive, an SD card or any relevant storage media needs to be prepared and flashed. This storage media will be used to update the device through the offline process. Plug in your storage media and run the following commands.

> Note: The process of flashing will delete all data stored on the storage media.

```bash
# list the devices available to flash
$ balena util available-drives

# Please make sure `--drive` is really the disk you want to write to.
$ sudo balena local flash ${tmpimg} \
    --drive /dev/{{flash-usb-disk}}

$ rm ${tmpimg}
```

### Process of Reprovisioning

> Warning: For devices with internal storage, this procedure erases the internal media of your device. Remove any mass storage devices containing user data.

With the update media already having the latest release of the fleet preloaded, follow the device's provisioning instructions present on balenaCloud dashboard for your specific device.

An example for Raspberry Pi devices: insert the recently flashed SD card and power up the device. When the process is complete, (re)connect any mass storage devices containing user data back to the device. Reconnect the device to the local air-gapped network(s). Later, use SSH to connect and inspect logs, etc.

#### Strategies to remotely update with an SD card or USB device

If a device isn't locally deployed, one can ship the flashed SD cards or USB sticks/drives to a remote location. There someone can run the update by simply inserting them into the devices and booting.

If the target device exists on an air-gapped or Internet restricted network, [inserting ssh keys][insert-ssh-key] during the configuration step will allow fleet managers at the remote site to connect to the device directly via OpenSSH and verify the update by examining container logs, etc.

If the target device is connected via a low-bandwidth connection, it should eventually establish a connection to balenaCloud. Depending on the connection's quality, it may respond to [web terminal][web-terminal] commands and output container logs to the dashboard.

### Update Device Registration(s)

This section deals with device registration in the cloud (balenaCloud or openBalena). The following steps help in manually reflecting the new state of the device for offline devices or devices on private networks without Internet access.

#### Patch State Endpoint - Update Device State in the Cloud

This step updates the device state in the cloud (balenaCloud or openBalena)
on behalf of the device, as if the device was online. It is only required for
devices that do not have an internet connection. If the device has an internet
connection, even if low bandwidth, this step may be skipped because the device
itself will be able to contact the cloud to update its state.

```bash
$ os_version_tag=$(echo ${os_version} | awk -F'+' '{print $1}')
$ os_version_semver=$(echo ${os_version_tag} | sed 's/v//g')
$ os_revision=$(echo ${os_version} | awk -F'+' '{print $2}' | awk -F'.' '{print $1}')
$ os_variant=$(echo ${os_version} | awk -F'+' '{print $2}' | awk -F'.' '{print $2}')

$ supervisor_version=$(curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balena-os/meta-balena/${os_version_tag}/meta-balena-common/recipes-containers/balena-supervisor/balena-supervisor.inc \
    | grep SUPERVISOR_TAG \
    | awk '{print $3}' \
    | sed 's/"//g' \
    | sed 's/v//g')

$ if [ -z "$BALENARC_BALENA_URL" ]; then BALENARC_BALENA_URL=balena-cloud.com; fi

$ release_id=$(curl --silent \
    "https://api.${BALENARC_BALENA_URL}/v6/release?\$filter=startswith(commit,'${commit}')&\$select=id" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.balena/token)" | jq -r .d[].id)

$ curl --silent \
    -X 'PATCH' "https://api.${BALENARC_BALENA_URL}/v6/device(uuid='${uuid}')" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.balena/token)" \
    -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    --data-binary "{\"os_variant\":\"${os_variant}\",\"os_version\":\"balenaOS ${os_version_semver}+${os_revision}\",\"supervisor_version\":\"${supervisor_version}\",\"is_running__release\":${release_id}}"
```

#### [Optional] Set Tags on Devices

Tags help identify and track devices in your fleet as to what commit and OS version have they been flashed & updated offline with. One can use [`balena tag set`][balena-tag-set] to create new tags as needed.

```bash
$ balena tag set 'offline:commit' "${commit}" \
  --device ${uuid}

$ balena tag set 'offline:hostOS' "${os_version}" \
  --device ${uuid}
```

title: Release policy
excerpt: Manage the fleet and device release policy
---

# Release policy

When managing a fleet, you may require devices to be running different releases. By default, fleets follow a rolling release policy where new releases are deployed to all devices in the fleet once successfully built. However, you can customize this behavior, so the fleet or individual devices remain on a fixed release, by utilizing release pinning.

You may define the fleet and device release policies via the [{{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard]({{ $links.dashboardUrl }}) or programmatically through the [API][api], [SDKs][sdk], or [CLI][cli].

## Pin fleet to a release

By default, the setting is set to `track latest`, which means that new releases are immediately deployed to all devices in the fleet when built. When the fleet is pinned, all devices that are not currently pinned to a release are updated to run the pinned release, and in the future, releases will not be deployed until the pinned release is updated to a different release or set to `track latest`.

You can set the release the fleet is pinned to via the Releases card on the on the Fleet Summary page. 

<img src="/img/common/release-policy/releases_card_dropdown.webp" width="100%" alt="Pin fleet to release from Releases card">

This can also be achieved using the `Pin to release` setting on the Fleet settings page.

<img src="/img/common/release-policy/pin_to_release_setting.webp" width="100%" alt="Pin fleet to release setting">

The dropdown menu at each of the above locations displays all successful and valid releases for the fleet. 

You can also pin a fleet to a release via the CLI as follows:
- Pin to a specific release: `balena fleet pin <FLEET_SLUG> <RELEASE_COMMIT>`
- Track latest: `balena fleet track-latest <FLEET_SLUG>`

## Pin device to a release

By default, all devices track the fleet release. However, you may wish to run a different release on select devices, for example, a development device or when performing a [canary deployment][canary].

There are several ways to achieve this from the Device dashboard. The dropdown options are identical to the ones when trying to pin the fleet to a release:

- On the Devices page, you can select one or more devices using the checkboxes present on the table. Next, open the `Modify` menu and select the `Pin to release` option.

<img src="/img/common/release-policy/devices_table_modify.webp" width="100%">

- Alternatively, on hovering over the `Target release` property in the Device summary page, you will see a pencil icon appear. This can be used to pin the release as well.

<img src="/img/common/release-policy/device_target_release_pencil.webp" width="100%">

- Lastly, the Settings page of a device also has the option to pin the release.

<img src="/img/common/release-policy/device_settings.webp" width="100%">

Once the device has been pinned to a release and updated, its `Target release` column updates to the pinned release. It will show a pin, rather than just showing the release targetted by the fleet. The `Release policy` column also updates to say `Pinned`.

<img src="/img/common/release-policy/target_release_pin.webp" width="100%" alt="Device release policy">

You can also pin a device to a release via the CLI as follows:
- Pin to a specific release: `balena device pin <DEVICE_UUID> <RELEASE_COMMIT>`
- Track latest: `balena device track-fleet <DEVICE_UUID>`

__Note:__ For more details about using the API to manage the release policy see the [Fleet Management Masterclass][masterclass].

title: Fleet update strategy
excerpt: Choosing an update strategy for your {{ $names.company.lower }} devices
---

# Controlling the update strategy

With the {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor version 1.3, we added the ability to choose the update strategy on devices, that is, the order and way in which the steps to perform an update are executed. You can check whether your Supervisor has the appropriate version in the "Supervisor version" entry in the device dashboard page.
These update strategies allow users to choose between four modes that are suited for different applications, depending on available resources and the possible need to have a container running at all times.

Update strategies can be applied by setting a [docker-compose label][labels]. The two labels that are involved are:

* `io.balena.update.strategy`, and
* `io.balena.update.handover-timeout`.

Setting the `io.balena.update.strategy` label to a valid value selects the update strategy. The possible values are:

* [`download-then-kill`](#download-then-kill) (default)
* [`kill-then-download`](#kill-then-download)
* [`delete-then-download`](#delete-then-download)
* [`hand-over`](#hand-over)

which are explained below. The `io.balena.update.handover-timeout` label is only used in the  `hand-over` strategy, and its use is explained in the [strategy's description](#hand-over).

__Note:__ Prior to balena Supervisor v7.23.0 the strategy was controlled by two configuration variables, `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_UPDATE_STRATEGY` and `RESIN_SUPERVISOR_HANDOVER_TIMEOUT`, which had the same effect as the labels do today. 
This mechanism for controlling the strategy is considered _deprecated_ and may be removed in the future.

All update strategies below honor the [fleet update locks][update-locks] which you can use prevent updates temporarily.

## download-then-kill

This is the default strategy, and it is selected if the variable is not set or if it has an invalid value. Its behavior corresponds to the way balena traditionally works:

* When an update is available, the Supervisor downloads the new container image.
* Once the download is complete, the Supervisor kills the container for the old version.
* Immediately afterwards, the Supervisor creates and starts the container for the new version, and then deletes the old image.

This strategy is suited for the general case of container update, where resources are not particularly constrained (as pulling the new image while the old container runs takes up some extra RAM), and when a zero-downtime update is not necessary but we still want to keep downtime to a minimum.

## kill-then-download

This strategy is meant for resource-constrained scenarios or when the images be pulled are particularly large, so we need to keep RAM usage to the minimum, albeit at the cost of some extra downtime.
It works as follows:

* When an update is available, the Supervisor kills the container for the old version.
* After this, the Supervisor downloads the image for the new version.
* Once the download is complete, the Supervisor creates and starts the new container, and deletes the old image from disk.

## delete-then-download

This strategy is meant for resource-constrained scenarios or when the images be pulled are particularly large, so we need to keep disk usage to the minimum, albeit at the **cost of extra downtime and higher bandwidth usage.**
It works as follows:

* When an update is available, the Supervisor kills the container for the old version, and then deletes the corresponding image.
* After this, the Supervisor downloads the image for the new version.
* Once the download is complete, the Supervisor creates and starts the new container.

__Note:__ This strategy is only recommended for extreme low storage scenarios, where the available storage cannot even fit the target [image deltas][update-deltas]. For most cases, using the default strategy or the `kill-then-download` strategy (if memory usage is a concern), and ensuring [deltas are enabled][update-deltas] is the recommended approach.

**Note: Requires Supervisor >= v2.5.1**

## hand-over

This strategy is suited for scenarios where there are enough resources and it is critical that the downtime is *zero*, that is, that the app runs continually even during an update.
For this strategy to work properly, the user has to consider the way the update works and include code to perform a handover between the old and new releases.
Its behavior is as follows:

* When an update is available, the Supervisor downloads the new image.
* When the download is complete, the Supervisor creates and starts the new container, *without killing the old one*.
* The old and new releases should communicate between each other so that the old one frees any resources that the new one needs (e.g. device files, database locks, etc) and the new version can start running fully.
* Once this "handover" is performed between the releases (old or new), your service must signal to the Supervisor that the old version is ready to be killed, by creating a file at `/data/resin-kill-me`.
* When the Supervisor detects that the file has been created, the Supervisor kills the old container and deletes it from disk.
* If the file is not created after a time defined by the `io.balena.update.handover-timeout` label, the Supervisor kills the old version.

The `io.balena.update.handover-timeout` label defines this timeout in milliseconds, and defaults to 60000 (i.e. 1 minute).
The communication between the old and new versions has to be implemented by the user in whatever way they see fit, for example by having the old version listen on a socket or port and having an endpoint for the new version to announce it's ready to take over. It is important to note that both versions will share the `/data` folder and network namespace, so they can use any of those to communicate.

# Apps

__Note:__ Apps are an experimental feature. To enable them, go to *Preferences → Experimental Options* and make sure "Display Apps" is checked.

An App is a multi-container resource which can be deployed to multiple fleets. Apps are intended to offer standalone functionality and can be constructed entirely or partially from [blocks][blocks]. Apps are designed to facilitate functionality sharing between both public and private fleets. They can be published on [balenaHub][balenaHubUrl] in order to allow other users outside of your balenaCloud organization to install and utilize them on their own fleets. Apps can exist independently to solve for a complete use case.

## What can Apps be used for?

Apps are a way to group together multiple containers that are deployed to a fleet of devices together in order to perform a complete function. They differ from blocks since they are intended to work standalone and do not require any further development or external containers to function for their use case.

Apps exist today for those developers who wish to share what they have built on [balenaHub][balenaHubUrl] in order to enable deployment to other fleets owned by other people using balenaCloud. Apps are created within balenaCloud, releases are pushed in the exact same way as with fleets, and then they can be [marked public](#publishing-an-app-on-balenahub) to publish them on balenaHub and share with others. In this manner, one App can be installed on multiple fleets.

An example of an App constructed in this way is [balenaSense](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sense). BalenaSense is built from the [dashboard](https://github.com/balenablocks/dashboard) and [connector](https://github.com/balenablocks/connector) blocks along with some additional containers. An App such as balenaSense could be deployed to a fleet to create an air-quality monitoring network, for example.


## Creating Apps

If you’ve previously worked with fleets on balenaCloud, the process of creating an App and [deploying][deploying] a release is very similar.

In order to create your own App, the code needs to be in a public GitHub repository. When an App is deployed, the latest code is pulled from GitHub. This will change in the future as and when we add support for private apps. The App has to include a [balena.yml][balenayml] file in the root directory of the project. Here's a balena.yml file of [balenaDash](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-dash) for reference:

```yaml

```



Next, navigate to the Apps tab in the sidebar and click the `Create App` button in the balenaCloud dashboard. Fill the details for your App in the modal, and click `Create new app` button to create your App. Next, we need to push a new release to your newly created App on balenaCloud. If you are new to this, then follow the [Getting Started](https://balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started/raspberrypi3/nodejs/) guide.

## Publishing an App on balenaHub

By default, Apps that you create within the balenaCloud dashboard are private and only accessible by the owner along with any other teams or members that you explicitly grant access to. When you are ready to release, head to the Settings tab in the sidebar and add your App’s GitHub repository to the Repository URL section. Next, toggle the App visibility button to on for your App to be visible on balenaHub. You’re free to toggle the visibility on and off as necessary at any time.

![Enable App visibility on balenaHub](/img/common/app/visibility-toggle.webp)

Apps marked with visibility set to ‘on’ in the dashboard will be made available as another resource for the community on balenaHub. Users can deploy Apps from balenaHub to their own fleets managed in their own balenaCloud accounts using the `Deploy` button with each App. 


## Deploying Apps from balenaHub

![Deploy an App from balenaHub](/img/common/app/deploy-from-balenahub.webp)

When the deploy button on balenaHub is used, the balenaCloud builder will fetch the latest source from the linked GitHub repository and create a new build for the chosen fleet. This process uses the [Deploy with balena](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/) workflow in order to guide users through the process of creating/signing in to a balenaCloud account, creating a fleet and deploying the App.


## Support access

If you require assistance with an App and have contacted balena for support, agents may ask you to ‘enable support access’ for the App. This can be achieved via toggling the `Support access` setting, found within the settings page to on. 

Once enabled, for security reasons, the support access toggle will revert back to ‘off’ at the time specified. 

![Enable support access](/img/common/app/enable-support-access.webp)

## Release management

To deploy new releases of your App, you can use the `balena push` command using the balenaCLI. The Releases tab in the sidebar will show the list of all releases of your App.

An App can be pinned to a specific release which will control which release is used to display content on balenaHub. Note that when a user deploys an app, the latest code is pulled from Github and is independent of this setting.


## Transfer App ownership

Apps with all their associated releases and members can be transferred to any other balenaCloud organization. App transfers are between a source and a target organization.

Only organization administrators can initiate and complete App transfers. You must coordinate with one of the receiving organization's administrators to perform the following actions:

* Take note of the App name in the source organization and your balenaCloud username (in the top-right drop-down menu).
* Ask an administrator of the target balenaCloud organization to create a new empty App using the same block name (the type doesn't need to match).
* Ask the administrator of the target balenaCloud organization to add you as a member of the newly created App with a Developer role, using your username. If you are an administrator of the target organization, you already have access to the new App & this step can be skipped.
* In the source organization, select Settings --> Set App ownership and pick the target organization from the list to complete the transfer.

__Note:__ If the dropdown for the destination organization is empty and grayed out, ensure that you have created an empty App in the target organization with the same name as the source App, and that the user that is transferring ownership of the App from the source organization has been added as a Developer to the target App.

Once the ownership has been set to the new owner, the source App owner will no longer be a member of the target App. If required, you will need to invite them to become a member of the App again. All other members of the source App will retain their membership of the target App once the transfer is complete.


## The future roadmap

The functionality for Apps we have today is only the start. Apps added via the dashboard can be shared on balenaHub for others to deploy to their own fleets which serves to help others, and we’ll continue building out to expand to installing private Apps on private fleets, automatic updates, and eventually the ability to install multiple Apps on a single fleet.

excerpt: A drop-in chunk of functionality that can be added to your fleet.

# Develop with blocks

A block is a container image that can be added to a multicontainer fleet in order to provide specific functionality. Blocks are intended to reduce the friction of app development by making it easier to re-use functionality, much like software packages. 

Similar to how software developers don't want to keep rewriting common functions, IOT developers don't want to keep creating containers for common tasks, such as handling Bluetooth connections or interacting with attached displays. Blocks provide solutions to common IoT application requirements, which developers can re-use to enable their fleet.

For example, getting a browser to run well in a container is a tedious task. Hence, why not use the [browser block][browser] to get things up and running faster..

<img src="/img/blocks/diagram-1.webp" width="70%">

## Getting Started with blocks

Since blocks are container images, they can be added to a multicontainer fleet. To use a block in your fleet, add the block's image as a new service in the `services` section of your app's `docker-compose.yml` file. This is similar to how we would build [multicontainer fleets][multicontainer].

Here's an example of using the [browser block][browser] in a sample multicontainer fleet already running 2 services.

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  # Browser block service added to the multicontainer fleet
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host

  # Existing services in the multicontainer fleet
  balena-node-hello-world:
    build: ./balena-node-hello-world
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - browser
    ports:
      - "80"
  importantBananaDb:
    image: importantBanana/db:latest
    ports:
      - "8080"
    environment:
      DB_ROOT_PASSWORD: 'potassium'
      RUN_MODE: 'super-secure'
```

Each block will have their own set of [docker-compose fields][docker-compose] which are required to configure the container they run within. Do take care of syntax and conflicts in the docker-compose.yml file when composing and deploying your multicontainer configuration.

## Creating your own block

Since blocks are container images, the process to create them is very similar to creating any other container. To learn more about what makes a good candidate for a block, refer to this [blog post](https://www.balena.io/blog/how-to-make-your-own-balenablocks-simple-drop-in-edge-app-functionality/). 

In order to create your own block, the code needs to be in a GitHub repository. It has to [include a balena.yml file](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/#balenayml-configuration-file) in the root directory of the project. Here's a balena.yml file of the [browser block](https://github.com/balenablocks/browser/) for reference:


```yml
name: browser
description: >-
  a hardware accelerated web browser to present internal and external URLs on a
  connected display
version: 2.3.2
type: sw.block
assets:
  repository:
    type: blob.asset
    data:
      url: 'https://github.com/balenablocks/browser'
  logo:
    type: blob.asset
    data:
      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balenablocks/browser/master/logo.png'
data:
  defaultDeviceType: raspberrypi3
  supportedDeviceTypes:
    - raspberrypi4-64
    - fincm3
    - raspberrypi3
    - raspberrypi3-64
    - raspberrypi400-64
    - intel-nuc
    - genericx86-64-ext
```

Next, navigate to the `Blocks` tab in the sidebar and click the `Create block` button in the balenaCloud dashboard.

<img src="/img/blocks/image.webp" width="100%">

Fill the details for your block in the modal, and click `Create new block` button to create your block.

<img src="/img/blocks/create-block.webp" width="70%">

Next, we have to [push a new release][balena-push] from your project to your newly created block on balenaCloud. If you are new to this, then follow the [Getting Started][getting-started] guide. After the release has been created, your block is ready. You can manage, modify and iterate further on your block from the balenaCloud dashboard.

## Release management for blocks

To deploy new releases of your block, you can use the [balena-push][balena-push] command using the [balenaCLI](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli). The `Releases` tab in the sidebar will show the list of all releases of your block.

<img src="/img/blocks/release.webp" width="80%">

By default, the block is set to `track latest`, which means that new releases are immediately tagged as the default release for the block. Expanding this _Default release_ dropdown menu displays all successful releases for the block, and you can select a specific release to pin the block to. When a particular release is selected, that release will be tagged as the default release of your block. After pinning to a specific release, releases will not be deployed until the _Default release_ is updated to a newer release or it's set back to `track latest`.

<img src="/img/blocks/release-mgmt.webp" width="100%">

## Making your block public

When a block is created on balenaCloud, it won't automatically be visible on balenaHub. When the block's visibility is toggled to `public`, it will get listed in the [Blocks section][blockhub] of balenaHub. Blocks aren't joinable like fleets or forkable like projects. Instead, the balenaHub page would provide the container image reference for the block, and instructions on how to deploy and use the block in your own fleet.

When blocks are private, you can iterate, test and build more functionality before making it available to the world. When you are ready to release, head to the `Settings` tab in the sidebar and add your block's GitHub repository to the `Repository URL`  section. Next, toggle the `Block visibility` button to `on` for your block to be visible on balenaHub. You’re free to toggle the visibility on and off as necessary at any time.

<img src="/img/blocks/settings.webp" width="100%">

This would lead to your block being available on [balenaHub][blockhub] for folks to use and build upon as soon as your submission has been marked as public. BalenaHub is the ever-growing library of blocks, projects and fleets contributed by the community.

## Using your block in other projects

The URL to pull your block image (the _image reference_) is available in balenaHub by clicking the `Use` button.

<img src="/img/blocks/use-button.webp" width="100%">

This image reference can be used in a Dockerfile or docker-compose file to pull the _default release_ image of your block.

Here's how to pull a specific release version given several available releases in the dashboard.

```yaml
services:
  # Browser block service added to the multicontainer fleet
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64/2.3.8
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
```

Note that specifying a revision via `+rev_` is not supported in image URLs as the plus sign is considered a special character. Instead, we will default to pulling the latest revision when a release version is provided.

So if there are multiple revisions of a release, for example `2.3.8`, `2.3.8+rev1`, and `2.3.8+rev2`, specifying `2.3.8` in the image reference will result in `2.3.8+rev2` being pulled.

During development you may want to pull a draft release for testing. Since draft releases are not included in the latest release track, you must specify the whole version string including the build stamp.

```yaml
services:
  # Browser block service added to the multicontainer fleet
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64/2.4.1-1648554962021
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
```

You can also refer to a release by its build commit by copying the commit hash from the first column of the releases dashboard.

```yaml
services:
  # Browser block service added to the multi-container fleet
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64/11e1ee23d7ddf6ab6da99bac26c9d274
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
```

Having the image reference available on balenaHub block page makes it easy to develop with blocks.

# Cloud IoT Provisioning with {{ $cloud.name }}

The [{{ $cloud.name }} IoT]({{ $cloud.platformUrl }}) platform provides a valuable suite of services to collect, store, and distribute IoT data and actions. Its [{{ $cloud.iotCoreName }}]({{ $cloud.iotCoreUrl }}) service is the portal for registration and messaging with Internet-connected things. We want to make it easy for balena devices to register and interact with {{ $cloud.iotCoreName }}.

Our IoT provisioning tools automate device registration to {{ $cloud.shortName }} {{ $cloud.iotCoreName }}, and leverage balenaCloud and environment variables to store and access the registration credentials. This guide shows you how provisioning works and gets you started with the tools in the [{{ $cloud.provisionRepoName }}](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/{{ $cloud.provisionRepoName}}) repository.

{{#is $cloud.shortName "ClearBlade"}}
  As its name suggests, {{ $cloud.name }} is a hybrid platform. {{ $cloud.shortName }} provides the IoT Core service, while Google Cloud (GCP) provides the underlying host platform for other services like the cloud function described below.
{{/is}}

## How It Works

![summary](/img/cloud-iot/iot-overview.webp)

Provisioning includes three components:

* **Service Container** like [Cloud Relay block](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/cloud-relay) on a device to request the provisioning and use the credential environment variables from balenaCloud
* **{{ $cloud.cloudFunctionName }} {{#isnt $cloud.cloudFunctionName "Cloud"}}(cloud){{/isnt}} function** to securely validate device identity and register the device with {{ $cloud.iotCoreName }}, triggered by an HTTP request ([source code](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/{{$cloud.provisionRepoName}}/blob/master/index.js))
* **balenaCloud** to accept and store the generated key/certificate credentials for the device

The cloud function first validates the device UUID in the provision request with balenaCloud. Then it generates a {{ $cloud.credentialType }} and registers with the {{ $cloud.iotCoreName }} service. The function then provides the generated credentials to balenaCloud, which stores and pushes them to the device as environment variables for use by the service container.

In addition to registration, Cloud Relay block makes it easy to send data to {{ $cloud.name }}. It integrates with balena's block [ecosystem](https://hub.balena.io/blocks) for application development and messaging. So you only need to send your data to an MQTT container on the device, and the block handles all of the interaction with {{ $cloud.iotCoreName }}.

__Note:__ A service container like Cloud Relay on the device is not *required* to send the provisioning request. You may call the cloud function HTTP endpoint from your compute infrastructure to pre-generate the key/certificate for the cloud. However, the device must be registered already with balenaCloud.

## Getting Started

The tools described here automate *per-device* integration with {{ $cloud.name }}. However, first you must complete some initial one-time configuration on your {{ $cloud.shortName }} account. See the [{{$cloud.shortName}} setup](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/{{ $cloud.provisionRepoName }}/#setup-and-testing) section of the provisioning repo documentation for details.

## Create, Deploy, and Test {{ $cloud.cloudFunctionName }} function

The provisioning tools set up the {{ $cloud.cloudFunctionName }} function itself as well as a `provision` HTTP endpoint to request provisioning based on a device's UUID. The [workspace setup](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/{{ $cloud.provisionRepoName }}/#workspace-setup) section of the documentation walks you through creation of this {{ $cloud.cloudFunctionName }} function and HTTP endpoint, including:


* configuration of the tools for testing and deployment
* testing the function locally
* deployment to {{ $cloud.platformName }} and end-to-end testing

The result is a functioning HTTP endpoint on {{ $cloud.platformName }}, ready for provisioning requests.

## Try a Tutorial

We created a blog post [tutorial](https://www.balena.io/blog/introducing-cloud-relay-block-send-data-to-cloud-provider/) on device provisioning with AWS IoT and use of Cloud Relay block to send system metrics data. The tutorial also shows how to route data sent to IoT Core on to Cloudwatch for graphing.

title: Define a container
excerpt: Use Dockerfiles to package your {{ $names.company.lower }} services and their dependencies
---

# Define a container

{{ $names.company.upper }} uses [Docker][docker] containers to manage deployment and updates. You can use one or more containers to package your services with whichever environments and tools they need to run.

To ensure a service has everything it needs, you'll want to create a list of instructions for building a [container image][docker-images-containers]. Whether the build process is done [on your device][local-mode], [on your workstation][local-build], or on the [{{ $names.company.lower }} builders][builders], the end result is a read-only image that ends up on your device. This image is used by the container engine (balena or Docker, depending on the {{ $names.os.lower }} version) to kick off a running container.

__Note:__ For additional information on working with Dockerfiles with {{$names.company.lower}} see the [services masterclass][services-masterclass].

## Dockerfiles

The instructions for building a container image are written in a [Dockerfile][dockerfile] - this is similar to a `Makefile` in that it contains a recipe or set of instructions to build our container.

The syntax of Dockerfiles is fairly simple - at core there are 2 valid entries in a Dockerfile - comments, prepended with `#` as in script files, and instructions of the format `INSTRUCTION arguments`.

Typically you will only need to use 4 instructions - [FROM][from], [RUN][run] and [ADD][add] or [COPY][copy]:-

* [FROM][from] __has__ to be the first instruction in any valid `Dockerfile` and defines the base image to use as the basis for the container you're building.

* [RUN][run] simply executes commands in the container - this can be of the format of a single line to execute, e.g. `RUN apt-get -y update` which will be run via `/bin/sh -c`, or `[ "executable", "param1", "param2", ... ]` which is executed directly.

* [ADD][add] copies files from the current directory into the container, e.g. `ADD <src> <dest>`. Note that if `<dest>` doesn't exist, it will be created for you, e.g. if you specify a folder. If the `<src>` is a *local* tar archive it will unpack it for you. It also allows the `<src>` to be a url but will **not** unpack *remote* urls.

* [COPY][copy] is very similar to [ADD][add], but without the compression and url functionality. According to [the Dockerfile best practices][dockerfile-best-practices], you should always use [COPY][copy] unless the auto-extraction capability of [ADD][add] is needed.

* [CMD][cmd] this command provides defaults for an executing container. This command will be run when the container starts up on your device, whereas RUN commands will be executed on our build servers. In a {{ $names.company.lower }} service, this is typically used to execute a start script or entrypoint for the user's service. [CMD][cmd] should always be the last command in your Dockerfile. The only processes that will run inside the container are the [CMD][cmd] command and all processes that it spawns.

For details on other instructions, consult the official [Dockerfile documentation][dockerfile].

### Using Dockerfiles with {{ $names.company.lower }}

To deploy a single-container release to {{ $names.company.lower }}, simply place a `Dockerfile` at the root of your repository. A `docker-compose.yml` file will be automatically generated, ensuring your container has host networking, is privileged, and has `lib/modules`, `/lib/firmware`, and `/run/dbus` bind mounted into the container. The default `docker-compose.yml` will look something like this:

{{> "general/labels-version-note"}}

```yaml
version: '2.1'
networks: {}
volumes:
  resin-data: {}
services:
  main:
    build:
      context: .
    privileged: true
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - 'resin-data:/data'
    labels:
      io.balena.features.kernel-modules: '1'
      io.balena.features.firmware: '1'
      io.balena.features.dbus: '1'
      io.balena.features.supervisor-api: '1'
      io.balena.features.balena-api: '1'
```

Releases with multiple services should include a `Dockerfile` or `package.json` in each service directory. A `docker-compose.yml` file will need to be defined at the root of the repository, as discussed in our [multicontainer documentation][multicontainer].

You can also include a `.dockerignore` file with your project if you wish the builder to ignore certain files.

__Note:__ You *don't* need to worry about ignoring `.git` as the builders already do this by default.

## Dockerfile templates

Dockerfile templates are a balena-specific feature that allow our builders to substitute a value for one of the following variables at build time:

{{> "deployment/build-variables" }}

The original purpose of these templates was to allow our builders to build containers for multiple architectures from one code repository when using the deprecated balenalib base images. For new projects, we recommend using standard Dockerfiles and either specifying the architecture in your FROM line, or utilizing base images that are published with the [multi-platform feature](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/). For example:

`FROM bh.cr/balenalabs/browser-aarch64`

Here, we are pulling an ARMv8 (aarch64) architecture-specific container image. This image can only be used for fleets with devices of that architecture. 

`FROM debian:trixie`

This Debian Official Docker image is a multi-arch image instead. Upon build time, the balena builders would pull the correct architecture of the image based on the default device type of your fleet. This reduces complexity and provides a similar feature set to Dockerfile templates in the past.

It is possible to have different device types in the same fleet, as long as they have the same or compatible architectures. You need to ensure that your packages and modules are also available in that target architecture, otherwise, your application might throw errors or fail during runtime.

If you are still using balenalib base images for an existing project, you can use dockerfile templates as described below:

```Dockerfile
FROM {{ $names.base_images.lib }}/%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_MACHINE_NAME%%-node

COPY package.json /package.json
RUN npm install

COPY src/ /usr/src/app
CMD ["node", "/usr/src/app/main.js"]
```

This `dockerfile.template` file will build and deploy a Node.js project for any of the devices supported by {{ $names.company.lower }}, regardless of device architecture, whether is [ARM][ARM-link] or [x86][x86-link].

In this example, the build variable `%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_MACHINE_NAME%%`. This will be replaced by the machine name (i.e.: `raspberry-pi`) at build time. Refer to [supported machine names and architectures][supported-devices].

The machine name is inferred from the device type of the fleet you are deploying on. So if you have a NanoPi Neo Air fleet, the machine name will be `nanopi-neo-air` and an `armv7hf` architecture base image will be built.

__Note:__ If your fleet contains devices of different types, the `%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_MACHINE_NAME%%` build variable **will not** evaluate correctly for all devices. Your fleet services are built once for all devices, and the `%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_MACHINE_NAME%%` variable will pull from the device type associated with the fleet, rather than the target device. In this scenario, you can use `%%{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_ARCH%%` to pull a base image that matches the shared architecture of the devices in your fleet.

If you want to see an example of build variables in action, have a look at this [basic openssh example]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/balena-openssh).


## Multiple Dockerfiles

There are cases when you would need a higher granularity of control when specifying build instructions for different devices and architectures than a single Dockerfile template can provide. An example of this would be when different configuration or installation files are required for each architecture or device.

When creating a release, the balenaCloud build servers or the balena CLI tool (depending on the deployment method used) look at all available Dockerfiles and build the appropriate image using the following order of preference:

* Dockerfile.\<device-type>
* Dockerfile.\<arch>
* Dockerfile.template

As an example, let's say you have two Dockerfiles available, `Dockerfile.raspberrypi3` and `Dockerfile.template`. Whenever you publish the application to balenaCloud, if the fleet `device-type` is Raspberry Pi 3, `Dockerfile.raspberrypi3` will be selected as an exact match and for all other devices the builder will automatically select `Dockerfile.template`.

Note that this feature works with the following commands: `git push`, `balena push`, `balena build`, and `balena deploy`.

## Node applications

{{ $names.company.upper }} supports [Node.js][node] natively using the [package.json][package] file located in the root of the repository to determine how to build and execute node applications.

When you push your code to your fleet, the build server generates a [container][container] for the environment your device operates in, deploys your code to it and runs `npm install` to resolve [npm][npm] dependencies, reporting progress to your terminal as it goes.

If the build executes successfully the release is deployed to your device where the supervisor runs it in place of any previously running containers, using `npm start` to execute your code (note that if no start script is specified, it defaults to running `node server.js`.)

### Node.js Example

A good example of this is the [text-to-speech][text-to-speech] application - here's its `package.json` file*:

```JSON
{
  "name": "text2speech",
  "description": "Simple balena app that uses Google's TTS endpoint",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "{{ $links.githubMain }}/text2speech.git"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "bash deps.sh"
  },
  "version": "0.0.3",
  "dependencies": {
    "speaker": "~0.0.10",
    "request": "~2.22.0",
    "lame": "~1.0.2"
  },
  "engines": {
      "node": "0.10.22"
  }
}
```

__Note:__ We don't specify a `start` script here which means node will default to running `server.js`. We execute a bash script called `deps.sh` before `npm install` tries to satisfy the code's dependencies. Let's have a look at that:-

```shell
apt-get install -y alsa-utils libasound2-dev
mv sound_start /usr/bin/sound_start
```

These are shell commands that are run within the container on the build server which are configured such that dependencies are resolved for the target architecture not the build server's - this can be very useful for deploying
non-javascript code or fulfilling package dependencies that your node code might require.

We use [Raspbian][raspbian] as our contained operating system, so this script uses [aptitude][aptitude] to install native packages before moving a script for our node code to use over to `/usr/bin` (the install scripts runs with root privileges within the container.)

__Note:__ With a plain Node.js project, our build server will detect compatible nodejs versions from the `package.json` and build the container using a Docker image that satisfies the version requirement. If no version is specified then the default node version is `0.10.22` and it will be used if a node version is not specified. There will be an error if the specified node version is not in our registry. You can either try another node version or contact us to be supported. More details about Docker node images in our registry can be found [here][base-images].

## Container Requirements

The {{ $names.company.lower }} Supervisor requires that the directory `/tmp/balena` in containers be available for inter-container communication via [update locks][update-locks]. Therefore, scripts should not attempt to remove this directory on startup.

title: Interact with hardware
excerpt: Access GPIO, I2C and SPI interfaces with {{ $names.company.lower }}
---

# Interact with hardware

For many projects, you may need to control or have access to some external hardware via interfaces like GPIO, I2C or SPI. For single-container fleets, you will automatically have access to `/dev` and these interfaces as the container is run in [**privileged** mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#/full-container-capabilities-privileged). This means you should be able to use any hardware modules like you would in a vanilla Linux environment.

Multicontainer fleets do not run containers in privileged mode by default. If you want to make use of hardware, you will have to appropriately configure your `docker-compose.yml` file to either set some services to privileged, using `privileged: true`, or use the `cap_add` and `devices` settings to map in the correct hardware access to the container.

As an example, here the `gpio` service is set up to use i2c and serial uart sensors:

```
gpio:
	build: ./gpio
	devices:
	  - "/dev/i2c-1:/dev/i2c-1"
	  - "/dev/mem:/dev/mem"
	  - "/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0"
	cap_add:
	  - SYS_RAWIO
```

__Note:__ If you are not using one of the Docker base images recommended in our [base images wiki][base-image-wiki-link], then it's most likely you will need to handle the updating of `/dev` via [udev][udev-link] yourself.

# GPIO

Recommended ways of interacting with GPIO on {{ $names.company.lower }} devices.

* [Raspberry Pi](/hardware/gpio#raspberry-pi)
* [Beaglebone](/hardware/gpio#beaglebone)

## Raspberry Pi

All Raspberry Pi SBCs have a header that includes a number of [General Purpose Input/Output ("GPIO")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) pins. These pins can be used to control external hardware such as LEDs, solenoids, motors, or other devices, as well as read data from various sensors. (The GPIO pins employ standard 3.3 volt logic and can't drive high current devices directly.) The earliest models used a 26 pin header, but all recent models use a 40 pin header. 

![Raspberry Pi](/img/rpi4.png)

#### Background

As Raspberry Pi models have evolved over the years, the hardware driving these GPIO pins has changed multiple times. The original Pi GPIO pins were directly driven from the SoC itself, while the Pi 5 uses a separate RP1 chip to drive the user-facing GPIO pins. For this reason, GPIO software libraries that use direct access to registers may stop working as hardware and kernel updates change the location of these registers.

This situation is very evident on libraries that depend on the long-deprecated `sysfs` interface, which is due to be removed completely from the Linux kernel.

The appropriate method to access GPIO features is via the standard Linux libgpiod library. Using a hardware abstraction such as this means the Linux kernel handles any differences in hardware that may be encountered between different models.

#### Library Access

The current Raspberry Pi GPIO libraries include:

 - [Libgpiod](https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a C library and set of tools for interacting with the Linux GPIO character devices (/dev/gpiochipX).


 - [Pinctrl](https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/tree/master/pinctrl) is a more powerful replacement for raspi-gpio, a tool for displaying and modifying the GPIO and pin muxing state of a system. It accesses the hardware directly, bypassing the kernel drivers


 - [Rpi-lgpio](https://rpi-lgpio.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.4/) is a compatibility package intended to provide compatibility with the rpi-gpio (aka RPi.GPIO) library, on top of kernels that only support the gpiochip device (and which have removed the deprecated sysfs GPIO interface).

These libraries have been tested to run equally well on multiple models of Raspberry Pi and various balenaOS and kernel versions. ([Example repository](https://github.com/balena-io-experimental/pi-gpio).) 

Much of this information and the image above is an excerpt from "A history of GPIO usage on Raspberry Pi devices, and current best practices" by [Raspberry Pi Ltd](https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/685-whitepapers-app-notes/documents/RP-006553-WP/A-history-of-GPIO-usage-on-Raspberry-Pi-devices-and-current-best-practices.pdf). 


## Beaglebone

Currently Beaglebone devices are running a new 4.1 kernel, unfortunately many of the userspace libraries haven't caught up yet so they only work with the older 3.8 kernel. Checkout the [Octalbonescript](https://github.com/theoctal/octalbonescript) JS library and a Node.js module here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/octalbonescript_capemgr4_1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/octalbonescript_capemgr4_1).

With this module you should be able to carry out basic GPIO and analog-to-digital conversion operations. To get you started we have a [example using this module]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/beaglebone-adc-node).

The [Adafruit BBIO](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python) library enables GPIO, PWM, ADC, UART, SPI, and eQEP hardware access from Python.

## Raspberry Pi Family

Many sensors and peripherals use either the [I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)][i2c-link] or the [SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)][spi-link] to communicate with the CPU. In most linux environments, using this kind of low level communication requires enabling a kernel module. In {{ $names.company.lower }} containers this can be done in a similar way because the containers are run in `--privileged` mode.

### I2C

I2C is enabled by default in BalenaOS via the `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` device tree parameter used on RaspberryPi devices. The i2c-dev module is loaded by the kernel automatically on startup. To access /dev/i2c-* char device files from a multi-container application, you can either list each file in your docker-compose.yml using device mappings:

```Dockerfile
services:
  my-service:
  ...
    devices:
      - "/dev/i2c-1:/dev/i2c-1"
```

or mark the container as privileged if you want to have all /dev/ nodes bind-mounted inside the container:

```Dockerfile
services:
  my-service:
  ...
    privileged:true
```

Single-container fleets run in privileged mode by default. If security and sandboxing are required then a multicontainer release should be created, even if only a single service is required.

To get you started, here is an [example project][balena-sense-example] that supports a variety of i2c sensors to build your own monitoring system for your environment and visualize data from a remote dashboard.

### SPI

SPI is enabled by default on {{ $names.os.lower }} via the `dtparam=spi=on` [device tree parameter][dt-params]. This default behavior can be modified by editing the [device configuration][device-configuration].

For Node.js applications it should work out of the box with the [spi node module][spi-npm]. For an example of this, check out this project: [digitiser][digitiser-link].

### Serial

Serial is disabled by default on the Raspberry Pi 3. To enable it you will need to do the following:

* Edit the `config.txt` in `{{ $names.company.short }}-boot` partition of the SD card and append the following lines.

```
enable_uart=1
```

### 1-wire and Digital Temperature sensors

In order to work work with 1-wire and digital temperature sensors you will need to do the following:

* Edit the `config.txt` in `{{ $names.company.short }}-boot` partition of the SD card and append the following lines.

```
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```
* Add `modprobe w1-gpio && modprobe w1-therm` before your start scripts in either your package.json start command or Dockerfile `CMD` command.

An example of this is shown in our [Firebase Temperature Logger][firebaseTemp-link] project.

### Using UART or Serial on Raspberry Pi 3

To enable UART on `GPIO14 / UART0 TX` and `GPIO15 / UART0 RX` , you will need to apply the `pi3-miniuart-bt` device tree overlay.
This can be done in two ways:
1. Add the following Device (or Fleet) Configuration variable to your device (or Fleet).
```
BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay = pi3-miniuart-bt
```

2. The second, more manual way to enable this configuration is to mount the SD card on your development machine. Find the `resin-boot` partition and in there you should see the Raspberry Pi's boot files, one of which is called `config.txt`. Open this file up and add the following line to the end of the file:
```
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
```

Now eject the SD card and pop it back into the RPI3, and you can boot the device up again.

To demonstrate this functionality, you can push this project ({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/rpi3-uart) to your RPI3. You will also need to add a small jumper wire between `GPIO14 / UART0 TX` and `GPIO15 / UART0 RX`, so that the data sent out of the UART is read back in and displayed in the logs.

### Raspberry Pi camera module

Depending on the version of your {{ $names.os.lower }}, the system contains different version of the Raspberry Pi firmware, and you need to apply slightly different settings. In both cases you can either modify `config.txt` on the `resin-boot` partition of your SD card, or add the settings remotely by using `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_variablename` settings in your [fleet or device configuration](/learn/manage/configuration/).

**{{ $names.os.upper }} 1.16.0 and newer**

Set the following values in `config.txt`:
```
gpu_mem=128
start_x=1
```
or for remote update
* `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` to `128`
* `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_start_x` to `1`
in the fleet or device configuration.

**{{ $names.os.upper }} 1.8.0 and earlier**

Set the following values in `config.txt`:
```
gpu_mem=128
start_file=start_x.elf
fixup_file=fixup_x.dat
```
or for remote update
* `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` to `128`
* `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_start_file` to `start_x.elf`
* `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_fixup_file` to `fixup_x.dat`
in the fleet or device configuration.

You will also need to add `modprobe bcm2835-v4l2` before your start scripts in either your `package.json` start command or Dockerfile `CMD` command.

An example of this is shown in our [Raspberry Pi python picamera][picamera-link] project.

### Raspberry Pi 7” Touchscreen Display

In order to work with the Raspberry Pi display you will need to do the following:

* Edit the `config.txt` in `resin-boot` partition of the SD card and append the following line.

```
device_tree_overlay=rpi-ft5406-overlay.dtb
```

If you want a quick example project to get you started with you new screen, you might want to checkout our [Raspberry Pi Electron starter App]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/electron-rpi-quick-start).

If you find that you need to change the orientation of you LCD screen, you can easily achieve this by adding the following key/value to your `/boot/config.txt` on your SD card:
```
lcd_rotate = 0
```
And set the value to either 0, 90, 180 or 270, depending on your desired orientation.

__Note:__ The 90 and 270 degrees rotation options require additional memory on GPU,
so won't work with the 16M GPU split.

### Customizing config.txt
These are some tips and tricks for customizing your raspberry pi. Most of them require changing settings in the `config.txt` file on the SD cards `boot` partition. See [here](/configuration/advanced/) for more details.

You can also set all of these variables remotely for a single device or the entire fleet using the Configuration tab on the device or fleet level respectively. If the setting in `config.txt` is `variable=value`, you can achieve the same settings by adding a configuration variable with `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_variable` set to the value `value`. For example:

![Setting the device configuration for Raspberry Pi config.txt variables](/img/hardware/host_config.webp)

For simplicity, below all examples are using the `config.txt` formatting, but all of them are available to set remotely as outlined above.

For further details and explanation regarding the settings below you may check the official [`config.txt` documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html).

##### Binary Blobs for GPU/vcore
This is necessary for any graphics acceleration or if you want to use the official raspberry pi camera module
```
gpu_mem=128
start_file=start_x.elf
fixup_file=fixup_x.dat
```

##### Increase USB current throughput:

This can be useful if you are running a power hungry USB peripheral like a 3G dongle.
```
max_usb_current=1
safe_mode_gpio=4
```

##### overclock RPI2:

```
arm_freq=1000
core_freq=500
sdram_freq=400
over_voltage=0
over_voltage_sdram_p=0
over_voltage_sdram_i=0
over_voltage_sdram_c=0
```
###### OR
```
arm_freq=1000
sdram_freq=500
core_freq=500
over_voltage=2
temp_limit=80 #Will throttle to default clock speed if hit.
```

##### Fill the screen to the edges

```
disable_overscan=1
overscan_left=4
overscan_right=4
overscan_top=4
overscan_bottom=4
```

## Beaglebone

Currently the Beaglebone devices are running a very new 4.1 kernel (which is obviously awesome), unfortunately many of the userspace libraries haven't caught up yet so they only work with the older 3.8 kernel. Luckily [ruth0000](https://github.com/ruth0000) was kind enough to patch the Octalbonescript JS library and made a lovely node.js module over here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/octalbonescript_capemgr4_1 .

With this module you should be able to basic GPIO and analog-to-digital conversion stuff. To get you started we have a simple example using this module [here]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/beaglebone-adc-node).

__Note:__ The ADC voltage is only rated to 1.8V, if you apply more you risk frying the pin.

### Capemgr support

__Warning:__ Capemgr is only supported in {{ $names.company.lower }} BBB devices with a 4.1 linux kernel. This kernel was only enabled in production on `25-09-2015`. If you don't know which kernel you are running, open a web terminal to your BBB and run `uname -a`.

##### Loading a Cape
```Bash
echo cape-universaln > /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots
```
##### Checking which Capes are loaded.
```Bash
cat /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots
```

```Bash
cat /sys/devices/platform/ocp/ocp:cape-universal/status

OCPDIR=/sys/devices/platform/ocp/ocp*
SLOTS=/sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots
```

### Disable HDMI

Before provisioning, mount the `.img`, in the `flash-boot` partition you should see a file named `uEnv.txt_internal` open that up with your favorite text editor and add
the following line to the bottom of the file:
```
fdtfile=am335x-boneblack-emmc-overlay.dtb
```

You should now be able to use any of the pins that used to be occupied by the HDMI. To test this you can run the following from your web terminal:
```bash
echo 74 > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio74/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio74/value
```
Pin 41 of Header P8 should go high.

## IOT-GATE-iMX8

### Serial ports

The IOT-GATE-iMX8 has at least one serial port that can be configured as either RS232 or RS485. To select the RS232 operating mode, in the host operating system, add the following line to `/mnt/boot/extra_uEnv.txt`:

```Bash
uart_mode=rs232
```

Similarly, rs485 can be selected in the environment file as well. The device should be rebooted after setting the uart operating mode the for the changes to take effect.

## Up Squared

### Serial Ports

Depending on the HAT Configuration defined in BIOS, the Up Squared UART communication on pins 8 and 10 can be performed using either `/dev/ttyS4` or `/dev/ttyS5`. Please consult the HAT Configurations menu in BIOS for details on how pins are configured on your device.

## Jetson Devices

### Custom device trees
Loading of custom device trees in balenaOS for Nvidia boards is supported by the Jetson Nano, Jetson TX2 and Jetson Orin family of devices. The list of devices that support this function includes:
- Floyd  Nano
- Jetson Nano SD-CARD
- Jetson Nano eMMC
- Jetson Nano 2GB Devkit SD
- JN30B  Nano
- Photon Nano
- Astro   TX2
- Jetson  TX2
- Jetson  TX2 NX (with Xavier NX Devkit)
- Orbitty TX2
- Photon  TX2 NX
- Spacely TX2
- Jetson AGX Orin Devkit
- Jetson Orin NX in Xavier NX Devkit NVMe (16GB RAM)
- Jetson Orin Nano 8GB (SD) Devkit NVME

Loading of custom device trees is not supported for the Jetson Xavier family of devices in balenaOS. U-Boot provides the complete set of functionality necessary for loading custom device-trees in balenaOS for the Jetson Nano and TX2 devices, and this bootloader is not supported by the Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson Xavier NX BSP. The Jetson AGX Orin family of devices uses a new Tegra UEFI bootloader which allows balenaOS to load custom device-trees.

To test a custom device tree on a Jetson Nano, TX2 or Jetson AGX Orin or Orin NX device, place your custom compiled device tree in the host operating system of your device, in the following path: `/mnt/sysroot/active/current/boot/`
After that, navigate to the `Device Configuration` tab in the balenaCloud dashboard, activate the following configuration with the description `Define the file name of the DTB to be used`, and specify the file name of the custom device tree. The value of this configuration should contain the file name only. After the change is applied, the device will automatically reboot and load the new device tree.

After the custom device tree has been validated, it can be included in newer balenaOS images. For Jetson TX2 and Nano, open a pull request in the [balena Jetson device](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson) repository following this [example commit](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson/commit/3dbf9c96e5986c2138f318d1ee9f0d5c1a2fc3c8). For the Jetson AGX Orin, the PR should be opened in the [balena Jetson Orin](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson-orin) repository. Once your PR is approved and merged, a new balenaOS image that includes your custom device tree will become available shortly.

Please note that if the changes for your carrier board expand past kernel device-trees, or require modifications to board configuration files like pin multiplexing configuration files or any other device-trees or files used by firmware, these may not be provided by the existing cloud images. During provisioning the resulting configuration changes are stored in the QSPI or in the hardware defined boot partitions, and thus will be replaced with the default values when updating the Host Operating System. Please [contact us](https://www.balena.io/contact-sales) if you would like to use a Jetson carrier board which may not be fully compatible with its' corresponding devkit, or with any of our cloud images for your Jetson module.

### Configurable fan profiles

Jetson Orin Devices running balenaOS revisions newer than v6.1.24 and supervisor versions greater than v16.10.0 offer support for configurable fan profiles. You can switch between the options provided by Jetpack by navigating to the Device/Fleet Configuration tab on the sidebar of the balenaCloud dashboard, clicking "activate" on the "Define the device fan profile" configuration option, and typing in the desired value. The input value should be a string, without quotes. The change will be applied at runtime and will not trigger a device reboot. Preloading the [fan profile configuration](/reference/OS/configuration/#fanprofile) before provisioning your device can be achieved by editing the [config.json](/reference/OS/configuration/#about-configjson) file.

### Configurable power modes

Jetson Orin Devices running balenaOS revisions newer than v6.1.24 and supervisor versions greater than v16.10.0 also offer the possibility for selecting the desired power mode. You can set the values *low*, *mid* and *high* or specify the power mode ID directly by navigating to the Device/Fleet Configuration tab on the sidebar of the balenaCloud dashboard, clicking "activate" on the "Define the device power mode" configuration option, and typing in the desired value. The input value should be a string, or a single digit number, without quotes. Please note that your device(s) will automatically reboot to apply the new power mode. The available power modes IDs for your device type are visible in the host OS in `/etc/nvpmodel.conf`. Preloading the desired power mode configuration can be achieved by editing the [config.json](/reference/OS/configuration/#about-configjson) file and specifying the desired [power mode](/reference/OS/configuration/#powermode) before provisioning the device.

### Container packages

The Jetson specific packages installed in your container images need to be in sync with the Linux for Tegra version used by the Host Operating System. Our base images for Jetson devices come pre-populated with `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia.list` files, which include the necessary links so that the apt repositories are in sync with the L4T version used by our latest OS images. If you suspect you encountered a mismatch, please check the `L4T` version in your Host OS using `uname -r` and compare it to the release version in your container's `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia.list` file. Please check our [Jetson Examples](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/jetson-examples) repository for more information on how to set-up your container images.

## iMX8 Devices

### Custom device-trees
Loading of custom device trees in balenaOS for iMX boards is currently supported on the Variscite DART-MX8M Mini and Variscite VAR-SOM-MX8M-MINI Devkit.

To test your custom device tree, place it in the host operating system of your device in the following path: `/mnt/sysroot/active/current/boot/` . Then, navigate to the `Device Configuration` tab in the balenaCloud dashboard, activate the following configuration with the description `Define the file name of the DTB to be used`, and specify the file name of the custom device tree. The value of this configuration should contain the file name only. After the change is applied, the device will automatically reboot and load the new device tree.

After you have validated your custom device, it can be included in newer balenaOS images by opening a pull request in the [balena-variscite-mx8](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-variscite-mx8) repository. Once your PR is approved and merged, a new balenaOS image which includes your custom device tree will be made available shortly.

# USB

* [balenaFin 1.x](#balenafin)
* [Raspberry Pi Family](#raspberry-pi-family)

## BalenaFin
On certain USB hubs, one can control the power per port. This is usually referred to as per port power switching or PPPS. BalenaFin 1.x uses the LAN9514 USB 2.0 hub + ethernet controller which supports PPPS. The recommended way to implement this is to make use of the [`uhubctl`](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl) tool.

1. You can add `uhubctl` to your container
```Dockerfile
ENV UDEV=on
RUN install_packages uhubctl
```

2. Once you have it installed, you can see the list of USB devices by simply running `uhubctl`
```bash
root@01d925a:/usr/src/app# uhubctl
Current status for hub 1-1 [0424:9514, USB 2.00, 5 ports]
  Port 1: 0503 power highspeed enable connect [0424:ec00]
  Port 2: 0100 power
  Port 3: 0100 power
  Port 4: 0103 power enable connect [0a12:0001]
  Port 5: 0503 power highspeed enable connect [0781:5567]
```

3. You can then turn off a particular port, in this case port 1 as follows -
```
root@01d925a:/usr/src/app# uhubctl -p 1 -a 0
Current status for hub 1-1 [0424:9514, USB 2.00, 5 ports]
  Port 1: 0503 power highspeed enable connect [0424:ec00]
Sent power off request
New status for hub 1-1 [0424:9514, USB 2.00, 5 ports]
  Port 1: 0000 off
```

4. If you run the `uhubctl` command again, you should see that port 1 is now off
```
root@01d925a:/usr/src/app# uhubctl
Current status for hub 1-1 [0424:9514, USB 2.00, 5 ports]
  Port 1: 0000 off
  Port 2: 0100 power
  Port 3: 0100 power
  Port 4: 0103 power enable connect [0a12:0001]
  Port 5: 0503 power highspeed enable connect [0781:5567]
```

## Raspberry Pi Family

`uhubctl` is also [supported](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl#compatible-usb-hubs) on Raspberry Pi boards. Check the [balenaFin](#balenafin) section above for instructions on getting started with `uhubctl`


--- docs-master/pages/learn/develop/local-mode.md ---

---
title: Develop locally
excerpt: Use {{ $names.company.lower }} local mode to prototype quickly
---

# Develop locally

Local mode is the development mode for {{ $names.company.lower }}. It allows you to build and sync code to a single development device in your local network without having to go through the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} build service and deployment pipeline. It uses the Docker daemon on the device to build container images, and then the device Supervisor starts the containers in the same way as if they were deployed via the cloud.

## Local mode requirements

To use local mode on a device:

- The device must be running {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.29.0 or higher.
- The device must be running a [development][development] variant of the OS.
- You must have the [{{ $names.company.lower }} CLI][cli] installed on your development machine.
- Local mode must be enabled through the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard. You can enable it from the device _Settings_ tab.

![Enable local mode](/img/local-mode/enable-local-mode.webp)

## Local mode caveats

- In local mode, a device will not send logs back to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard. Refer to the [local mode logs section](#local-mode-logs) to view logs in local mode.
- Device and service environment variables set from the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} will not be applied to local mode containers. It is still possible to set environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`.
- Changes to device [configuration][configuration], for example, `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem`, will result in the device rebooting and applying those settings.
- Actions such as _Restart services_ and _Purge data_ will not apply to local mode containers.
- When switching out of local mode and back to tracking releases from {{ $names.cloud.lower }}, the Supervisor will destroy any local mode containers and volumes, as well as clean up unneeded base images, and then start the release that {{ $names.cloud.lower }} instructs it to run.

![Device in local mode](/img/local-mode/device-in-local-mode.webp)

## Scan the network and find your device

Before you can get your app running on your device in local mode, you have to find your device. You can find the `short-uuid` and local IP address of the device from the device dashboard or by scanning the network. To perform a scan, login to the {{ $names.company.lower }} CLI and use `{{ $names.company.short }} device detect` to find any local {{ $names.os.lower }} devices. All {{ $names.os.lower }} devices advertise themselves on the network using [Avahi][avahi]. The names take the form `<short-uuid>.local`, where the `short-uuid` is the UUID you see on your device dashboard.

__Note:__ You may need administrator privileges to run `{{ $names.company.short }} device detect` as it requires access to all network interfaces.

**Command**

```bash
sudo {{ $names.company.short }} device detect
```

**Output**

```bash
Reporting scan results

  dockerVersion:
    Version:    18.09.8-dev
    ApiVersion: 1.39

```

## Push over a new project

When local mode has been activated, {{ $names.company.lower }} CLI can push code directly to the local device instead of going via the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} builders. As code is built on the device and then executed, this can significantly speed up development when requiring frequent changes. To do this, we use the `{{ $names.company.lower }} push` command providing either the local IP address or `<short-uuid>.local`, obtained from the preceding `{{ $names.company.short }} device detect` command.

__Note:__ By default `{{ $names.company.short }} push` will build from the current working directory, but it is also possible to specify the project directory via the `--source` option.

Once the code has been built on the device, it immediately starts executing, and logs are output to the console. At any time, you can disconnect from the local device by using `Ctrl-C`. Note that after disconnection, the services on the device will continue to run.

**Command**

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} push 63ec46c.local
```

**Output**

```

### Livepush

Local mode also has another huge benefit, known as [Livepush][livepush]. Livepush makes intelligent decisions on how, or even if, to rebuild an image when changes are made. Instead of creating a new image and container with every code change, the Dockerfile commands are executed from within the running container. This means that, for example, if you added a dependency to your `package.json`, rather than having to install all of the dependencies again, only the new dependency would be installed.

When a source file is modified, the Supervisor will immediately detect the change and then either rebuild the image or, for source files that run in-service, replace the changed files in situ in the relevant container layer and restart the service. As this happens in a few seconds, it makes the process of developing much faster and more convenient.

```bash
[Live]    Detected changes for container main, updating...
[Live]    [main] Restarting service..
```

__Note:__ You can disable Livepush by passing the `--nolive` option to `{{ $names.company.short }} push`. In this case to rebuild on the device you will need to perform another `{{ $names.company.short }} push`.

### Local mode logs

By default, when pushing code to a device in local mode using the {{ $names.company.lower }} CLI, the logs will be output to the console. You can prevent this by passing the `--detached` (`-d`) option to the `{{ $names.company.short }} push` command (you may also detach the console at any time by pressing `Ctrl-C`).

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} push 63ec46c.local --detached
```

When detached, the services continue to run on the device, and you can access the logs using the `{{ $names.company.short }} device logs` command, again passing the local IP address or `<short-uuid>.local`.

```shell
{{ $names.company.short }} device logs 63ec46c.local
```

This command will output logs for the system and all running services. You may optionally filter the output to include only system or specific service logs using the available `--system` (`-S`) and `--service` (`-s`) options. For example, to output only the system logs:

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} device logs 63ec46c.local --system
```

To filter logs by a service, use the `--service` option. You may specify this option multiple times to output logs from multiple services.

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} device logs 63ec46c.local --service main
{{ $names.company.short }} device logs 63ec46c.local --service first --service second
```

These options can be combined to output system and selected service logs e.g.

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} device logs 827b231.local --system --service first --service second
```

__Note:__ You may also specify the `--service` and `--system` options using the `{{ $names.company.short }} push` command to filter the log output.

## SSH into the running app container or host OS

To access the local device over [SSH][ssh], use the `{{ $names.company.short }} device ssh` command specifying the device IP address or `<short-uuid>.local`. By default, SSH access is routed into the host OS shell and, from there, we can check system logs and [perform other troubleshooting tasks][troubleshooting]:

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} device ssh 192.168.86.45
```

To connect to a container, we can specify the service name e.g.

```bash
sudo {{ $names.company.short }} device ssh 63ec46c.local my-service
```

__Note:__ If an IP address or a `.local` hostname is used (instead of a fleet name or device UUID), `{{ $names.company.short }} device ssh` establishes a direct connection to the device on port `22222` that does not rely on cloudlink.

## Using a Private Docker Registry

If your project relies on a private base image, then it is possible to specify your registry credentials when doing a `{{ $names.company.short }} push` by passing the `--registry-secrets` option, as shown below.

```bash
{{ $names.company.short }} push 192.168.86.45 --registry-secrets /Path/To/File/dockerhub-secret.yml
```

Where `dockerhub-secret.yml` is a YAML file containing my private registry usernames and passwords to be used by the device {{ $names.engine.lower }} when pulling base images during a build.

Sample secrets YAML file:

```yaml
'https://index.docker.io/v2/':
  username: johnDoe
  password: myPassword
```

title: Multiple containers
excerpt: A guide to running multiple containers with Docker Compose and {{ $names.company.lower }}
---

# Multiple containers

As your apps grow more complex, you may find significant benefit in running some services in separate containers. Splitting your app into multiple containers allows you to better isolate and maintain key services, providing a more modular and secure approach to fleet management. Each service can be packaged with the operating environment and tools it specifically needs to run, and each service can be limited to the minimum system resources necessary to perform its task. The benefits of multicontainer fleets compound as the complexity of the app grows. With multicontainer, each service is updated independently. Hence, larger apps can be developed and maintained by separate teams, each free to work in a way that best supports their service.

__Note:__ For additional information on working with multiple containers with {{$names.company.lower}} see the [services masterclass][services-masterclass].

This guide will cover the considerations you need to take into account when running multiple containers, including `docker-compose.yml` configuration and some important {{ $names.company.lower }} specific settings.

## docker-compose.yml file

The multicontainer functionality provided by {{ $names.company.lower }} is built around the **[Docker Compose][docker-compose]** file format. The {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor implements a subset of the [Compose v2.1 feature set][compose-features]. You can find a full list of supported and known unsupported features in our [device supervisor reference docs][compose-support].

At the root of your multicontainer release, you'll use a `docker-compose.yml` file to specify the configuration of your containers. The `docker-compose.yml` defines the services you'll be building, as well as how the services interact with each other and the host OS.

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` for a [simple multicontainer release][simple-app], composed of a static site server, a websocket server, and a proxy:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    restart: always
    expose:
      - "80"
  proxy:
    build: ./haproxy
    depends_on:
      - frontend
      - data
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  data:
    build: ./data
    expose:
      - "8080"
```

Each service can either be built from a directory containing a `Dockerfile`, as shown here, or can use a **Docker** image that has already been built, by replacing `build:` with `image:`. If your containers need to be started in a specific order, make sure to use the `depends_on:` [setting][depends-on].

__Note:__ Note that `depends_on` only controls the startup order and will not restart services if a dependency restarts. Also if a service is expected to stop after performing some actions, do not include it as a dependency or the service that depends on it may not start.

Unlike single container fleets, multicontainer fleets do not run containers in privileged mode by default. If you want to make use of hardware, you will either have to set some services to privileged, using `privileged: true`, or use the `cap_add` and `devices` settings to map in the correct hardware access to the container. 

Also, in a balena device, unlike with regular docker compose, containers restart by default if their process crashes or the device is restarted. This behavior can be changed by setting the restart policy to one of the [values supported by the engine](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#restart) (the default is `restart: always`).

As an example, here the `gpio` service is set up to use i2c and serial uart sensors and a restart policy of `on-failure`. 

```Dockerfile
gpio:
    build: ./gpio
    devices:
      - "/dev/i2c-1:/dev/i2c-1"
      - "/dev/mem:/dev/mem"
      - "/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0"
    cap_add:
      - SYS_RAWIO
    restart: on-failure
```

## {{ $names.company.upper }} settings

There are a few settings and considerations specific to {{ $names.company.lower }} that need to be taken into account when building multicontainer fleets.

### Network mode

Setting `network_mode` to `host` allows the container to share the same network namespace as the host OS. When this is set, any ports exposed on the container will be exposed locally on the device. This is necessary for features such as bluetooth.

### Named volumes

With multicontainer fleets, {{ $names.company.lower }} supports the use of named volumes, a feature that expands on the [persistent storage][persistent-storage] functionality used by older versions of {{ $names.os.lower }}. Named volumes can be given arbitrary names and can be linked to a directory in one or more containers. As long as every release of the fleet includes a `docker-compose.yml` and the volume name does not change, the data in the volume will persist across updates.

Use the `volumes` field of the service to link a directory in your container to your named volume. The named volume should also be specified at the top level of the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'
volumes:
    resin-data:
services:
    example:
        build: ./example
        volumes:
            - 'resin-data:/data'
```

For devices upgraded from older versions of {{ $names.os.lower }} to v2.12.0 or higher, a link will automatically be created from the `/data` directory of the container to the `resin-data` named volume (similar to above). This ensures fleet behavior will remain consistent across host OS versions. One notable difference is that accessing this data via the host OS is done at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/<FLEET ID>_resin-data/_data`, rather than the `/mnt/data/resin-data/<FLEET ID>` location used with earlier host OS versions.

{{ $names.company.lower }} does not support the use of bind mounts at this time, aside from the ones which are provided by [feature labels][feature-labels].

### Core dumps for containers

{{ $names.os.upper }} v2.113.31 and later, by default, will not generate core dump files when a container crashes. This prevents a buggy container that is crash looping to fill up all available storage space on a device.

[Core dumps][core-dump-link] are files with the contents of the memory used by a process at the time it crashes. They are a relatively advanced troubleshooting tool, particularly useful for low-level debugging of programs written in languages that compile to native code. For example, a tool like the `gdb` debugger can read a core dump and provide a stack trace showing the sequence of functions calls that led to the crash.

If you need core dumps, you can easily enable them by editing your `docker-compose.yml` and setting `ulimits.core: -1` for the desired services. For example:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
    example:
        ulimits:
            core: -1
```

### Labels

In addition to the settings above, there are some {{ $names.company.lower }} specific labels that can be defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. These provide access to certain bind mounts and environment variables without requiring you to run the container as privileged:

{{> "general/labels" }}

### Container requirements

**Note:** Container requirements are available when using balenaCLI >= 21.1.0

An additional set of labels ensures device compatibility for running a service. For example, before updating to a new release, it may be desirable to ensure that the device is running a specific version of [Supervisor][supervisor] or has a specific version of the [NVIDIA Tegra Linux Driver Package][l4t] (L4T).

The following set of requirement labels are enforced via the supervisor. Each service may define one or more requirements and if any of them is not met for any non-[optional](#optional-containers) service, then [the release will be rejected][update-statuses] and no changes will be performed for the new release.

| Label                                                          | Description                                                               | Valid from Supervisor |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| io.{{ $names.company.short }}.features.requires.sw.supervisor  | Device Supervisor version (specified as a [version range][version-range]) | 10.16.17              |
| io.{{ $names.company.short }}.features.requires.sw.l4t         | [L4T][l4t] version (specified as a [version range][version-range])        | 10.16.17              |
| io.{{ $names.company.short }}.features.requires.hw.device-type | The [device type][device-type] as given by `BALENA_MACHINE_NAME`          | 11.1.0                |
| io.{{ $names.company.short }}.features.requires.arch.sw        | The [architecture][arch] as given by `BALENA_ARCH`                        | 14.10.11              |

For example, the following composition defines requirements on the supervisor and l4t version on the first service, and on the device type and architecture on the second service.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  first-service:
    build: ./first-service
    labels:
      io.balena.features.requires.sw.supervisor: '>=14'
      io.balena.features.requires.sw.l4t: '>=32.2.0'
  second-service:
    image: my-second-image
    labels:
      io.balena.features.requires.hw.device-type: 'jetson-nano'
      io.balena.features.requires.arch.sw: 'aarch64'
```

#### Optional containers

By default, when a container requirement is not met, none of the services are deployed to the device. However, in a multi-container release, it is possible to ignore those services that do not meet requirements with the other services being deployed as normal. To do so, we make use of the `io.balena.features.optional: 1` label to indicate which services should be considered optional.

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, add the `io.balena.features.optional: 1` to the labels list for each service you wish to mark as optional. In the following example, even if the `first-service` requirements fail, the `second-service` service will still be deployed.

```Dockerfile
version: '2'
services:
  first-service:
    build: ./first-service
    labels:
      io.balena.features.requires.hw.device-type: 'jetson-nano'
      io.balena.features.optional: '1'
  second-service:
    build: ./second-service
```

**Note:** When updating between releases, if the new version of and optional service has unmet requirements, the old version of the service will still be killed.

# Communicate outside the container

In many situations, the code running in your container will need some way to communicate with outside services and devices, whether this means the host OS, the device supervisor, the network, or internal and external storage. Below, you'll find different methods for external communication, as well as some tips and tricks to keep in mind.

## Host OS

### Environment variables

Inside your running container, you'll have access to a number of `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_` namespaced environment variables, which provide information from the system outside the container:

__Note:__ On all {{ $names.os.lower }} versions of the OS, both `RESIN_` and `BALENA_` variables will be injected into the container to maintain backwards compatibility.

|    Variable   	| Description 	|
|:----------:	    |:-----------:	|
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_UUID` 	      |  The unique identification number for the device. This is used to identify it on {{ $names.company.lower }}	|
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_APP_ID` 	            |  ID number of the {{ $names.company.lower }} fleet the device is associated. 	|
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_APP_NAME`            |  The name of the {{ $names.company.lower }} fleet the device is associated with. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_NAME_AT_INIT` |  The name of the device on first initialization. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_TYPE`         |  The type of device the fleet is running on. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}` 	                  |  The `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}=1` variable can be used by your software to detect that it is running on a {{ $names.company.lower }} device. 	|
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY`  |  Authentication key for the supervisor API. This makes sure requests to the supervisor are only coming from containers on the device. See the [Supervisor API reference][supervisor-api-link] for detailed usage. For multicontainer the service needs the [io.{{ $names.company.lower }}.features.supervisor-api][labels-link] label set. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS` 	|  The network address of the supervisor API. Default: `http://127.0.0.1:48484`. For multicontainer the service needs the [io.{{ $names.company.lower }}.features.supervisor-api][labels-link] label set. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_HOST` 	  |  The IP address of the supervisor API.	Default: `127.0.0.1`. For multicontainer the service needs the [io.resin.features.supervisor-api][labels-link] set|
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_PORT` 	  |  The network port number for the supervisor API. Default: `48484`. For multicontainer the service needs the [io.{{ $names.company.lower }}.features.supervisor-api][labels-link] label set. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_API_KEY` 	          |  API key which can be used to authenticate requests to the {{ $names.company.lower }} backend. Can be used with the SDKs on the device. **WARNING** This API key gives the code permissions to affect the device's metadata in the balena API; refer to our [security documentation][security-docs-link] for more details. For multicontainer the service needs the [io.{{ $names.company.lower }}.features.{{ $names.company.lower }}-api][labels-link] label set. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_HOST_OS_VERSION`     |  The version of the host OS. |
| `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_RESTART` 	    |  This is an internal mechanism for restarting containers and can be ignored as it's not very useful to app code.  Example: `1.13.0`	|

Here's an example from a Raspberry Pi 3:

```Bash
root@raspberrypi3-cc723d7:/# printenv | grep {{ $names.company.allCaps }}
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY=1111deadbeef2222
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_APP_ID=157270
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_TYPE=raspberrypi3
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}=1
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:48484
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_HOST=127.0.0.1
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_UUID=cb6f09d18ab4c08556f54a5bd7cfd353d4907c4a61998ba8a54cd9f2abc5ee
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_API_KEY=deadbeef12345
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_APP_NAME=Example
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_NAME_AT_INIT=damp-haze
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_HOST_OS_VERSION={{ $names.os.lower }} 2.20.0
{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_PORT=48484
```

### D-Bus communication with host OS

In some cases it's necessary to communicate with the host OS systemd to perform actions on the host. To do this you can use [dbus][dbus-link]. In order to ensure that you are communicating to the host OS systemd and not the systemd in your container it is important to set `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS` for all D-Bus communication. The setting of that environment variable is different for older and newer devices (based on the {{ $names.company.lower }} supervisor version), choose the line that is correct for your device's OS version (can be found in your device dashboard):

__Note:__ In multicontainer fleets, the `io.balena.features.dbus` label must be applied for each service that requires access to the D-Bus. If you have devices with a supervisor version lower than 7.22.0, you should use `io.resin.features` labeling as that will ensure backward compatibility.

```
# for {{ $names.company.lower }} supervisor versions 1.7.0 and newer (both {{ $names.os.lower }} 1.x and 2.x) use this version:
DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
```

```
# for {{ $names.company.lower }} supervisor before 1.7.0 use this version:
DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host_run/dbus/system_bus_socket
```

Below you can find a couple of examples. All of them requires either prepending the command with the above `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=...` or setting the variable for all commands by running `export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=...` with the correct environment variable value from above.

In multicontainer fleets, you can also set `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket` in the `environment` section of your service in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  someservice:
    environment:
      - 'DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket'
    labels:
      io.balena.features.dbus: '1'
```

__Note:__ Please be aware that setting `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS` as a service or environment variable and enabling systemd at the same time might introduce unexpected side effects. Systemd might start to interact with the host system instead of the container. These interactions can potentially cause balenaOS devices to disconnect from balenaCloud or even fall offline. Hence, users are advised to prefer prepending the command with the variable definition.

__Note:__ To use the `dbus-send` command in the example you will need to install the `dbus` package in your Dockerfile if you are using the Debian image, or check under what name does your chosen operating system supply the `dbus-send` executable.

#### Change the Device hostname

Changing the device hostname via a dbus-send method invocation of `org.freedesktop.hostname1.SetHostname` is no longer possible, due to the fact that this would attempt to write to `/etc/hostname`, which on the [host OS][host-os] is stored in the read-only root partition. To change the device hostname, use the [balena supervisor API][supervisor-api-device-host-config]


#### Rebooting the Device
```Bash
DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket \
  dbus-send \
  --system \
  --print-reply \
  --dest=org.freedesktop.systemd1 \
  /org/freedesktop/systemd1 \
  org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager.Reboot
```

#### Stopping a systemd service
At times, you may wish to stop a running service on the host OS, such as `bluetooth.service`, in order to run your own instance of bluez containerized.

```Bash
DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket \
  dbus-send \
  --system \
  --print-reply \
  --dest=org.freedesktop.systemd1 \
  /org/freedesktop/systemd1 \
  org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager.StopUnit \
  string:bluetooth.service string:replace
```

#### Checking if device time is NTP synchronized
```Bash
DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket \
  dbus-send \
  --system \
  --print-reply \
  --reply-timeout=2000 \
  --type=method_call \
  --dest=org.freedesktop.timedate1 \
  /org/freedesktop/timedate1  \
  org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll \
  string:"org.freedesktop.timedate1"
```

The reply would look like this:
```variant
method return time=1474008856.507103 sender=:1.12 -> destination=:1.11 serial=4 reply_serial=2
   array [
      dict entry(
         string "Timezone"
         variant             string "UTC"
      )
      dict entry(
         string "LocalRTC"
         variant             boolean false
      )
      dict entry(
         string "CanNTP"
         variant             boolean true
      )
      dict entry(
         string "NTP"
         variant             boolean true
      )
      dict entry(
         string "NTPSynchronized"
         variant             boolean true
      )
      dict entry(
         string "TimeUSec"
         variant             uint64 1474008856505839
      )
      dict entry(
         string "RTCTimeUSec"
         variant             uint64 1474008857000000
      )
   ]
```

The entry `NTPSynchronized` shows `true`, so the device is NTP synchronized.  (The key `NTP` only shows whether the device is using the systemd service `systemd-timesyncd`; starting from balenaOS 2.13.1, the `chrony` service is used for time management.)

__Note:__ For additional D-Bus examples see the [{{$names.os.lower}} masterclass][os-masterclass]

### Blacklisting kernel modules won't work
Since the `/etc/modules` you see in your container belongs to the container's filesystem and is not the same as `/etc/modules` in the host OS, adding kernel modules to the modules blacklist in the container will have no effect. So in order to remove a module, you need to explicitly do a [`rmmod`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/rmmod).

## Supervisor

__Note:__ In multicontainer fleets, the `io.balena.features.supervisor-api` label must be applied for each service that requires access to the Supervisor API.  If you have devices with a supervisor version lower than 7.22.0, you should use `io.resin.features` labeling as that will ensure backward compatibility

### Reboot from Inside the Container

You may notice that if you issue a `reboot`, `halt`, or `shutdown` your container either gets into a weird zombie state or doesn't do anything. The reason for this is that these commands do not propagate down to the host OS system. If you need to issue a `reboot` from your container you should use the supervisor API as shown:
```
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
    "${{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS/v1/reboot?apikey=${{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY"
```
[Read more about the supervisor API](/runtime/supervisor-api/#post-v1-reboot)

__Note:__ `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_API_KEY` and `{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_SUPERVISOR_ADDRESS` should already be in your environment by default for single containers, but for multicontainer devices the service needs the [io.resin.features.supervisor-api][labels-link] set . You will also **need** `curl` installed in your container.

Alternatively, it is possible to reboot the device via the D-Bus interface as described above.

### Writing to logs on the Dashboard

Anything written to `stdout` and `stderr` should appear on the device's dashboard logs. Have a look at some of our [example projects][projects-github] on GitHub to get an idea of how to do this.

## Network

{{ $names.engine.upper }} supports [host][network-host] and [bridge][network-bridge] network modes:

* Host mode allows a service to use all host network interfaces.
* Bridge mode uses a user-defined bridge network interface, to which service containers are connected.

Any service that uses host networking does not have to define ports for traffic ingress, and a service can bind to all interfaces of the host. Single container releases always use host networking.

In contrast to host networking, bridge networks isolate all services from the host, requiring services to explicitly define open ports to allow traffic from the host to be passed to them (all outgoing traffic is permitted). By default, multicontainer releases use a bridge network.

### Single container

Single container releases always use host networking, allowing them to bind to any of the host's network interfaces. If security and sandboxing are required for either privilege level or to ensure self-contained networking, then a multicontainer release should be created, even if only a single service is required.

### Multicontainer

Multicontainer releases use a user-defined bridge network by default. No ports are exposed to the host and must be explicitly enabled through the `ports` [keyword][network-ports]. Services on the same bridge network have access to all other services' ports.

The following [sample multicontainer][multicontainer] `docker-compose.yml` file allows incoming traffic on port 80 to the `proxy` service, but the `frontend` and `data` services are isolated from the host and only accessible via the bridge network, which all services are connected to.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    expose:
      - "80"
  proxy:
    build: ./haproxy
    depends_on:
      - frontend
      - data
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  data:
    build: ./data
    expose:
      - "8080"
```

__Note:__ Exposing ports via the expose keyword is optional and a way of documenting which ports are used, but does not map or open any ports. By default, services on the same bridge network have access to all other services' ports.

For multicontainer releases, setting the service `network_mode` to `host` in `docker-compose.yml` allows the container to share the same network namespace as the host OS.

{{ $names.company.upper }} `docker-compose.yml` files support the creation of multiple bridge networks allowing you to compartmentalize further, so that some services exist in only one defined network, whereas others may be able to communicate in many. The `aliases` [keyword][network-aliases] for providing alias names for services (including FQDNs) and [IPAM bridge networks][network-ipam] are also supported.

__Note:__ For more information on networking with {{ $names.company.lower }}, see the [{{ $names.company.lower }} services masterclass][services-masterclass].

### Public device URLS

{{ $names.company.upper }} currently exposes port 80 for web forwarding. To enable web forwarding on a specific device, navigate to the device's **actions** tab on the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard and select the `Enable a public URL for this device` button. For more information about device URLs see the [Device Management Page](/management/devices#enable-public-device-url)

<img alt="Enable public device URL" src="/img/common/device/enable-public-url-device.webp">

Running a server listening on port 80 with public device URL enabled will allow you to serve content from the device to the world. Here is an example of an [express.js][expressjs-link] server which will serve to the devices URL.

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

var server = app.listen(80, function () {

  var host = server.address().address
  var port = server.address().port

  console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port)

})
```

### Using DNS resolvers in your container
In the {{ $names.company.lower }} host OS [dnsmasq][dnsmasq-link] is used to manage DNS since {{ $names.os.lower }} 1.1.2. This means that if you have dnsmasq or other DNS resolvers such as [bind9](https://bind9.net/) running in your container, it can potentially cause problems because they usually try to bind to `0.0.0.0`, which interferes with the host dnsmasq. To get around this, you need to add `bind-interfaces` to your dnsmasq configuration in your container or make sure your server only binds to external IPs, and there shouldn't be conflicts anymore.

## Storage

### Persistent Storage

{{> "general/persistent-storage"}}

### Temporary directories

Note that the `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` directories in a container are not true [tmpfs][kernel-tmpfs] volumes by default, and they are treated like any other ephemeral container layers.

As a result, you can expect that data in these directories will persist over a device reboot, but will **not** persist when a [services restart][restart-fleet] is triggered.

If you would like these directories to act more like `tmpfs` volumes and write to volatile memory, you can use [tmpfs mounts][tmpfs-mounts].

```yml
services:
  myapp:
    image: foo/bar
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
      - /var/tmp
```

### Mounting external storage media

Since the release of multicontainer on the {{ $names.company.lower }} platform we no longer recommend the use of an initsystem in the container. This affects the way we deal with external storage since previously we relied on `systemd`/`OpenRC` and `/etc/fstab`.

The recommended way for mounting external storage media (SD cards, USB sticks, external drives, etc) into a container is now through the use of `mount`. Here we include a set of recommendations that will help you get started.

**{{ $names.os.lower }} kernel support**

Before you start it's a good idea to check if the {{ $names.os.lower }} kernel you are running was compiled with support for the filesystem you want to use. To do so, you can run this command on the **host** which will produce a list of supported filesystems: `cat /proc/filesystems`.

If your filesystem is not supported you can contact us through our [forums](https://forums.balena.io/) and we will be glad to help.

**Preparing the container**

In order to be able to detect external media dynamically you will need to run the container in privileged mode and enable `udevd` on it. This can be easily done if you are using [balena base images](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/balena-base-images/#working-with-dynamically-plugged-devices) by:

- Adding `privileged: true` to your container's service definition on the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Adding `ENV UDEV=on` to your container's `Dockerfile`.
- Running the entrypoint as the `root` user in the container namespace. This is often the default but can be set in your container's `Dockerfile` with `USER root` in the target build stage, or in your `docker-compose.yml` file with `user: root`.

This will ensure that the host propagates udev events into the container, enabling us to manipulate the device from within it.

**General tips for external media**

Devices can be selected in many ways, for example by its device name (`/dev` entry), label, or UUID. From a practical point of view, we recommend using labels (`LABEL=...` entries). Labels can easily be made the same across multiple cards or thumb drives, while you can still identify each device by their UUID. Also, `/dev` entries are not static on some platforms, and their value depends on which order the system brings up the devices. Device names or UUIDs are a good choice when you can easily identify or predict their values, for example within the context of a udev rule.

__Note:__ You can get a list of device names, labels and filesystem types by running `lsblk -f` (both on the host or container).

**Mounting**

To mount an external drive you can use Linux's `mount` command. Again, any selection method is supported:

```bash
mount -t <fstype> -o rw <device-name> <mount-point>
mount -t <fstype> -o rw -L <device-label> <mount-point>
mount -t <fstype> -o rw -U <device-uuid> <mount-point>
```

__Note:__ The mount point folder needs to exist for the mount to be successful.

For more information about the `mount` command see the [mount man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html).

**Unmounting**

To unmount an external drive you can use Linux's `umount` command:

```bash
umount <mount-point>
```

For more information about the `umount` command see the [umount man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/umount.8.html).

**Automounting/unmounting with udev rules**

The previous sections show how to manually mount or unmount external media. You probably want to automate this and have your media automatically mount/unmount when you plug it or unplug it. Fortunately this can be easily achieved by using udev rules.

First we create a rules file `usb.rules`:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="partition", RUN+="/bin/sh -c '/usr/src/scripts/mount.sh'"
ACTION=="remove", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="partition", RUN+="/bin/sh -c '/usr/src/scripts/unmount.sh'"
```

These rules will trigger every time we plug or unplug a block partition device and run the scripts we provide (`/usr/src/mount.sh` or `/usr/src/unmount.sh`).

Copy both the rules and scripts to your container:
```Dockerfile
COPY usb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/usb.rules
COPY scripts /usr/src/scripts
```

Finally we need to write the `mount.sh` and `unmount.sh` scripts. These scripts will use `mount` and `umount` commands in the same way we described on the **Mounting** and **Unmounting** sections above.

You can find a fully working example of automounting/unmounting devices with udev rules in this [project]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/balena-storage).

**Sharing mounted devices across containers**

Note that currently it's not possible to share a mounted device across multiple containers. This is a feature that we are currently working on. This documentation will be updated once we add support for this feature.

title: "Getting started: {{ $device.name }} and {{ $language.name }}"

layout: getting-started.html

dynamic:
  variables: [ $device, $language ]
  ref: $original_ref/$device/$language
  $switch_text: I want to develop on balena with $device using $language
---

# {{ title }}

In this guide, we will help you get started with {{ $names.cloud.lower }} by:

- Setting up your **{{ $device.name }}** device and bringing it online on the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard.
- Deploying a **{{ $language.name }}** hello-world project on the device.
- Developing the sample project: making changes and testing them on the device in real-time.

Once you've completed this getting started guide to balena, you'll be equipped with the fundamentals needed to continue developing your application using {{ $names.cloud.lower }} and be on the path to deploying fleets of devices to production. If you are looking for definitions of certain terms, refer to the [glossary][balena-glossary].


## What you'll need

{{import "getting-started/whatYouNeed"}}


## Create a fleet 

A fleet is a group of devices that share the same [architecture][architecture] and run the same code. Devices are added to fleets and can be moved between fleets at any time.

To create your first fleet, log into your [{{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard][dashboard] and click the **Create fleet** button.

<img alt="Create a fleet" src="/img/common/create-first-fleet.webp" width="100%">

Enter a fleet name, select the **{{ $device.name }}** device type, choose the *Starter* [fleet type][fleet-types], and click **Create new fleet**:

<img src="/img/getting-started/create-fleet.webp" width="80%">

You'll then be redirected to the summary of the newly created fleet, where you can add your first {{ $device.name }}.


## Add a device and download OS

<!--add an anchor here to redirect old links-->
<a name="adding-your-first-device"></a>

<img alt="Add a device" src="/img/getting-started/fleet-view.webp" width="100%">

{{ $names.cloud.lower }} builds a custom {{ $names.os.lower }} image configured for {{ $device.name }} which allows the device to provision and join the new fleet you created automatically. Start by clicking **Add device** on the fleet summary. Your device type will be preselected here since you already chose it when creating the fleet. Other device types of the same [architecture][architecture] can also be picked to join the fleet.

<img alt="Add new device" src="/img/getting-started/add-device.webp" width="80%">

Select an OS type of _balenaOS_, and you will see a list of available {{ $names.os.lower }} versions with the latest preselected. Choose a **Development** version of the OS. The production OS does not facilitate the development workflow we'll be using. Find out more about the [differences between Development and Production images][devvprod].

<img alt="Network configuration" src="/img/common/app/network.webp" width="80%">

Select the type of network connection you'll be using: *Ethernet Only* or *Wifi + Ethernet*. A network connection is required to allow the device to connect to {{ $names.cloud.lower }}. Selecting *Wifi + Ethernet* allows you to enter a *Wifi SSID* and *Wifi Passphrase* which is then built into the image.

<img alt="Download Image" src="/img/common/app/download_image.webp" width="50%">

Finally, click the **Download {{ $names.os.lower }}** button. When the download completes, you should have a zipped image file with a name like `{{ $names.company.short }}-First-Fleet-{{ $device.id }}-2.80.3+rev1-v12.7.0.img.zip`.


## Provision device

<!-- This section is heavily customized based on the device -->

Next, we will flash the downloaded image onto the device. To do so, follow the following steps:

<!-- Loop through device instructions-->
{{#$device.instructions}}
{{this}}
{{/$device.instructions}}

When complete, after a minute or two the device should appear on your {{$names.cloud.lower}} [dashboard]({{ $links.dashboardUrl }}), and you should now be ready to deploy some code. If you are not able get the device to appear on the dashboard, then check out our [troubleshooting guide for {{ $device.name }}][troubleshooting-{{ $device.id }}] or try our [support channels][support].


## Install the {{ $names.cli.lower }}

Now that you have an `operational` device in your fleet, it's time to deploy some code. We will use the {{ $names.cli.lower }} for this. Follow the instructions below to install balenaCLI for the operating system available on your system. Skip the next part if you have balena CLI already installed. 

{{import "getting-started/cliInstructions"}}

After {{ $names.cli.lower }} is installed, login to your {{ $names.company.lower}} account
using the `{{ $names.company.lower }} login` command on the terminal:

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.lower }} login
 _            _
| |__   __ _ | |  ____  _ __    __ _
| '_ \ / _` || | / __ \| '_ \  / _` |
| |_) | (_) || ||  ___/| | | || (_) |
|_.__/ \__,_||_| \____/|_| |_| \__,_|


Logging in to cloud.com
? How would you like to login? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Web authorization (recommended)
  Credentials
  Authentication token
  I don't have a balena account!
```

You will be asked to choose an authentication method, choose _Web authorization_ which will 
bring up a web browser window that allows you to login to your {{ $names.cloud.lower }} 
account. Click the **Authorize** button, and head back to the terminal after the login 
successful message appears.

<img alt="Web authorization" src="/img/common/cli/web_authorization.webp" width="70%">


## Create a release

After login, test the {{ $names.cli.lower }} by running the `{{ $names.company.lower }} fleet list` command, which should return information about the fleet you created in the previous step. Take a note of the fleet `NAME` as you'll need this in the next step to push the code to your device(s) in that fleet.

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.lower }} fleets
ID    NAME         SLUG                                 DEVICE TYPE           DEVICE COUNT   ONLINE DEVICES
98264 First-Fleet  {{ $names.cli.lower }}/first-fleet    {{ $device.name }}    0              0
```

A nice project to try is the [balena-{{ $language.id }}-hello-world][balena-{{ $language.id }}-hello-world] project.
It's a {{ $language.name }} web server that serves a static page on port 80. To get started, [download the project][github-download-{{ $language.id }}]
as a zipped file from GitHub, unzip it and open a terminal in the root of the extracted project directory.

To create a release, use the `{{ $names.company.lower }} push First-Fleet` command replacing 
`First-Fleet` with the name of your fleet. Ensure you are working from the root of the extracted project directory.

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.lower }} push First-Fleet
```

This command pushes the code to the {{ $names.company.lower }} builders, where it will be compiled, built, turned into a release, and applied to every device in the fleet.

You'll know your code has been successfully compiled and built when our friendly unicorn mascot appears in your terminal:

```shell

                        <`\\_  \         .`-.
                         \ r-7  `-. ._  ' .  `\
                          \`,      `-.`7  7)   )
                           \/         \|  \'  / `-._
                                      ||    .'
                                       \\  (
                                        >\  >
                                    ,.-' >.'
                                   <.'_.''
                                     <'
```

The release will then be downloaded and started by all the devices in the fleet. You can see the progress of the device code updates on the device dashboard:

<img alt="Service download progress" src="/img/common/device/download-progress.webp" width="100%">

After the download, you should now have a {{ $language.name }} web server running on your device and see some logs on your dashboard. 

To give your device a public URL, click the _Public Device URL_ toggle on the device dashboard. Public device URL allow you to serve content from the device to the world easily without configuration as long as the server is running on port 80. 

<img alt="Enable public URLs" src="/img/common/device/enable-public-url-device.webp" width="60%">

Follow the URL to view the welcome page with additional resources. Alternatively, you can point your browser to your device's local IP address to access the server running on your device. You can find the device's IP address on the device dashboard page. This is what you should be seeing. 

<img alt="Success screen 1" src="/img/getting-started/success.webp" width="60%">


## Developing your project

Now, let's try making some changes to this project and testing them right on the device. The project can be modified and pushed again using the same method as above, but since we are using a development version of the OS, we can enable *Local mode* and push directly to the device for a faster development cycle.

Activate local mode on the device via the dashboard.

<img alt="Enable Local Mode" src="/img/local-mode/enable-local-mode.webp" width="60%">

Once enabled, you can now use `balena push` again, but this time we will push directly to the local IP address of the device obtained via the dashboard.

<img alt="Local IP address" src="/img/getting-started/local-ip-address.webp" width="60%">

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.lower }} push 10.19.0.153
```

The same build process as before is carried out, but this time instead of using the {{ $names.company.lower }} builders, the build takes place locally on the device itself.

```shell
[Info]    Streaming device logs...
[Live]    Watching for file changes...
[Live]    Waiting for device state to settle...
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:58:18 AM] Creating network 'default'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:58:19 AM] Installing service 'hello-world sha256:...'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:58:20 AM] Installed service 'hello-world sha256:...'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:58:20 AM] Starting service 'hello-world sha256:...'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:58:23 AM] Started service 'hello-world sha256:...'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:58:24 AM] [hello-world] Starting server on port 80
[Live]    Device state settled
```

The {{ $names.cli.lower }} will now watch for changes to all the files within the project, and automatically push changes to the device when detected. Let's try making a change to title of our balena welcome page. Navigate to the `index.html` file present in the `static` directory of the project. Open the file and change the title from `Welcome to balena!` to `Hello balena!` and save the file. After saving the changes, you can observe {{ $names.cli.lower }} automatically start rebuilding only the parts of the Dockerfile that has been changed.

```shell
[Live]    Detected changes for container hello-world, updating...

...
[Live]    [hello-world] Restarting service...
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:59:01 AM, 2:42:32 AM] Service exited 'hello-world sha256:...'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:59:04 AM, 2:42:35 AM] Restarting service 'hello-world sha256:...'
[Logs]    [8/26/2021, 11:59:05 AM, 2:42:36 AM] [hello-world] Starting server on port 80
```

When the rebuild is complete, take a look at the public device URL again to see your changes. The welcome page should have been updated with the new title.

<img alt="Success screen 2" src="/img/getting-started/success-change.webp" width="60%">


## Next steps

Once you've finished making your changes, disable local mode and the device will revert back to running the latest release that's on your fleet. To update your fleet with the latest changes you've just worked on, use `balena push <fleet name>` once more to create a new release with those changes. 

When it's finished building the device(s) will update as before. Remember anything pushed to the fleet in this way can be applied to 10+ or 1000+ devices with no extra effort! To continue learning, explore parts of the guide in more detail:

- Learn more about [local mode][local-mode], which allows you to build and sync code to your device locally for rapid development.
- Develop an application with [multiple containers][multicontainer] to provide a more modular approach to fleet management.
- Manage your device fleet with the use of [configuration][configuration], [environment][service], and [service variables][service].
- Find out more about the [{{ $names.cli.lower }}][cli] and the functionality it offers.
- Visit our blog to find step-by-step tutorials for some [classic balena projects][projects].
- To publish what you will build or have already built, head over to [balenaHub][balenahub].

title: Actions and Settings
---

# Actions and Settings

Actions and Settings allow you to control the status of your fleets and the devices that are part of it during runtime. Most operations can be applied in one of three ways:

1. Accessing the *Settings* tab from the fleet summary page allows you to make changes to the fleet in general, and to all the devices in that fleet.
2. The *Actions* or *Settings* menu on the device summary page lets you apply changes that only affect that one device.
3. To apply operations on a subset of devices, you can specify which devices will be affected by clicking the check boxes next to the devices in the devices list. When selected, use the *Modify* dropdown menu on the devices list to apply the operation on only the selected devices. This is helpful in case you use filters or a saved view to run operations frequently on a subset of devices. 

## Device actions

[Fleet members][fleet-members] with the Operator role and above can perform any of the actions or settings listed below.

### Restart Services

The `Restart Services` action restarts the currently running **services** for all devices in your fleet. Your fleet's running containers will be removed and recreated from scratch. This behavior is intended and is different from running `balena restart [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]` in a host OS terminal instance from your dashboard, which will not remove your containers. If you are trying to persist data between container removals, see [persistent storage][persistent-storage] for strategies.

By removing containers and recreating them from scratch, we see benefits like the following:

- Containers are meant to be ephemeral, meaning that a new container should be a drop-in replacement for an old container with minimal to no impact. Removing and recreating containers adheres to this philosophy.

- Because containers are removed and recreated with the restart action, you're encouraged to follow best practices in Docker data persistence. For more information, see our [persistent storage][persistent-storage] documentation or [Docker's data persistence strategies][docker-data-persistence-strategies]. These strategies also offer a performance boost over storing files in the container's writable layer.

- Removing and recreating containers may allow recovery from release bugs where the container was stuck in an invalid state. For example, a process ID file that is no longer valid but is persisted to the container filesystem would be cleaned up when recreating the container.

When the containers are being restarted, the containers are politely asked to stop by sending a `SIGTERM`. If the containers haven't stopped after 10 seconds, a `SIGKILL` is sent.

__Note:__ During a restart any data that is not stored in `/data` will be lost.

It should be noted that currently these action notifications are not queued up, so if a device is offline when the action is triggered, it will never be notified of it.

__Warning:__ Restart device container is not equivalent to a reboot of the device!

### Purge Data

This action clears [persistent storage][persistent-storage] on any applicable devices. For devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} versions before 2.12.0, this means clearing the `/data` folder in the container (and the associated volume at `/mnt/data/resin-data`). On newer {{ $names.os.lower }} versions, this action deletes all named volumes and recreates them as empty.

It should be noted that currently these action notifications are not queued up, so if a device is offline when the action is triggered, it will never be notified of it.

__Warning:__ This action is only supported on devices with an Agent version >= 1.1.0

### Reboot

This action allows you to perform a reboot on your devices. This is different from the `Restart Services` action mentioned above. With this action, the entire device, including the kernel, will be rebooted as if there was a power cycle. It should be noted that currently these action notifications are not queued up, so if a device is offline when the action is triggered, it will never be notified of the action it missed.

__Warning:__ This action is only supported on devices with an Agent version >= 1.1.0

### Shutdown

The `Shutdown` action allows you to safely shut down your devices. It should be noted that once you trigger this action, there is no way for {{ $names.company.lower }} to start your device back up, so you will need to physically restart your device. Obviously this action is not a wise choice if your device is somewhere remote and inaccessible

__Warning:__ This action is only supported on devices with an Agent version >= 1.1.0

### Delete Device

The `Delete Device` action is an extremely dangerous action and results in disassociating the device from the fleet and remote endpoint. Once you have deleted a device from the fleet it is not possible to reconnect to it unless you set it back up again. The device itself will continue to run the container and code you pushed most recently, but will never be able to receive new updates or commands from the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard or API.

## Device settings

[Fleet members][fleet-members] with the Operator role and above can perform any of the actions listed below.

### Public Device URL

{{ $names.company.upper }} currently exposes **port 80** for web forwarding. This setting enables web forwarding and generates a web accessible url for any applicable devices. The URLs will be of the form `<{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_UUID>.balena-devices.com`, where `<{{ $names.company.allCaps }}_DEVICE_UUID>` is the unique ID of the device which you can see on your dashboard. Currently only HTTP traffic (level 7 OSI traffic) is supported via the device URLs.

The Public Device URL feature is a tool for remote configuration, debugging, and other intermittent or periodic use cases. The feature is built on [Cloudlink](/learn/welcome/security/#cloudlink) and not designed for high availability. We do not recommend using the Public Device URL feature for continuous use as part of your application.

For applications that require a stable, continuously available public endpoint, we recommend using a dedicated tunneling service designed for production use.

### Move device to another Fleet

With the `Fleet` setting it is possible to transfer a device from one fleet to another. This allows you to incrementally rollout devices or move certain devices to specific branches of functionality. To move a device from one fleet to another, click the `Fleet` dropdown on the Device Settings page and you will be presented with a list of compatible architecture fleets that you can move your device to.

Note that you are only able to move devices between fleets with device types that share the same architecture. For example, a Raspberry Pi 3 device could be moved to a BeagleBone Black fleet, but not to an Intel NUC fleet.

Obviously you may only select one fleet to transfer your device to. Once you select the appropriate radio button, your device will immediately appear in the selected fleet's device list. Note that it will take a while for the device to start the update process as it does not receive a push notification of a new code update from the API, so it has to wait for the update poll, which happens every couple of minutes.

__Warning:__ For devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} version 2.12.0 and above, data in [persistent storage][persistent-storage] (named volumes) is automatically purged when a device is moved to a new fleet. On older host OS versions, the `/data` folder in the new fleet will not contain any of the old fleet data, but it can still be accessed via the host OS and if the device is switched back to the original fleet. Unless you plan to revert back to the original fleet, be sure to [purge][purge-data] the `/data` folder.

### {{ $names.os.upper }} Update

This setting allows you to remotely update the host OS running on your device. For more details on supported devices and the update process, check out our {{ $names.os.lower }} [update documentation][updates].

### Local Mode

Turning on local mode is useful when you are prototyping your services, as it allows you to push changes to your device over the local network without relying on the {{ $names.company.lower }} build pipeline. You can find more information in our [development guide][local-mode].

### Deactivate Device

This setting will [deactivate the device][inactive-devices] and charge a one-time deactivation fee (equivalent to the cost of a single undiscounted device-month) that is not covered by your plan's allowance. To deactivate, the device must be offline and be attached to a valid billing account.

Once the device is deactivated, the device won't be counted towards your device total. It will remain inactive until it comes back online.

### Grant Support Access

This setting allows you to [enable support access][support-access] for one or more devices for a set time period.

## Fleet/Block/App settings

These settings can be found on the "Settings" menu for each fleet and apply to the fleet and all the devices in the fleet. [Fleet members][fleet-members] with the administrator role can perform any of the settings listed below.

### Change Fleet Type

This option allows you to convert your fleet to [another type][fleet-types], as long as the devices in the fleet meet the {{ $names.os.lower }} version requirements and your account has the appropriate privileges.

### Rename Fleet

This operation allows you to rename your fleet. This operation is only available `Microservices` and `Essentials` [fleet types][fleet-types]. It's not currently possible to rename `Legacy` or `Classic` fleets, you will first need to upgrade your fleet type.

### Transfer Fleet Ownership

Fleets with all their associated devices, releases and members can be transferred to any other balenaCloud [organization][organization]. Upon transfer, your fleet ID and UUID will remain the same, fleet history will be maintained, and you will be able to roll back to a prior release.

Fleet transfers are between a **source** and a **target** organization. If you are transferring a **source** fleet from a [paid plan to a free plan](https://www.balena.io/pricing/) and your fleet exceeds the device limit, your fleet will be frozen until a plan is purchased for the **target** organization.

Only organization [administrators][administrator] can initiate and complete fleet transfers. You must coordinate with one of the receiving organization's administrators to perform the following actions:

1. Take note of the fleet name in the **source** organization and your balenaCloud username (*in the top-right drop-down menu*).
2. Ask an administrator of the **target** balenaCloud organization to create a new empty fleet using the same fleet name (the [fleet type][fleet-types] doesn't need to match).
3. Ask the administrator of the **target** balenaCloud organization to [add you as a member][add-application-member] of the newly created fleet with a [`Developer`][developer] role, using your username. If you are an administrator of the **target** organization, you already have access to the new fleet & this step can be skipped.
4. In the **source** organization, select **<Fleet>** --> **Settings** --> **Set this fleet's ownership** and pick the **target** organization from the list to complete the transfer.

__Note:__ If the **Set this fleet's ownership** button is grayed out, ensure that you have created an empty fleet in the **target** organization with the same name as the source fleet, and that the user that is transferring ownership of the fleet from the source organization has been added as a **Developer** to the **target** fleet.

Once the transfer of ownership has been completed, the source fleet owner will no longer be a member of the target fleet. If required, you will need to invite them to become a member of the fleet again. All other members of the source fleet will retain their membership of the target fleet once the transfer is complete.

During and after the transfer process, the devices state will remain unchanged from before the transfer process was started. For example, devices that were online before the process was started will remain online throughout.

### Transfer Block Ownership

Blocks with all their associated releases and members can be transferred to any other balenaCloud [organization][organization]. Block transfers are between a **source** and a **target** organization.

Only organization [administrators][administrator] can initiate and complete block transfers. You must coordinate with one of the receiving organization's administrators to perform the following actions:

1. Take note of the block name in the **source** organization and your balenaCloud username (*in the top-right drop-down menu*).
2. Ask an administrator of the **target** balenaCloud organization to create a new empty block using the same block name.
3. Ask the administrator of the **target** balenaCloud organization to [add you as a member][add-application-member] of the newly created block with a [`Developer`][developer] role, using your username. If you are an administrator of the **target** organization, you already have access to the new block & this step can be skipped.
4. In the **source** organization, select **<block>** --> **Settings** --> **Set this block's ownership** and pick the **target** organization from the list to complete the transfer.

__Note:__ If the **Set this block's ownership** button is grayed out, ensure that you have created an empty block in the **target** organization with the same name as the source block, and that user that is transferring ownership of the block from the source organization has been added as a **Developer** to the **target** block.

Once the transfer of ownership has been completed, the source block owner will no longer be a member of the target block. If required, you will need to invite them to become a member of the block again. All other members of the source block will retain their membership of the target block once the transfer is complete.

### Delete Fleet

This option permanently deletes your fleet.

__Warning:__ It is a good idea to [move your devices to another fleet][move-devices] before deleting your current fleet. If you do not, **all devices attached to the fleet will become orphaned and you will need to reconfigure them from scratch**. The most recent code deployment will continue to function as before, but the devices will not be able to receive code updates or device operations from {{ $names.company.lower }}.

## Release settings

These settings can be found on the "Settings" menu for each release.

### Validation Status

This option can be used to mark your release as valid or invalid. Entities can only be pinned to valid releases. If you invalidate a release, any devices that are running it and are not pinned to it will be updated to the fleet's target release. If an entity is pinned to a release when it is invalidated, it will not be affected. If you wish to allow pinning to the release again, you could re-validate it via this same setting.

### Delete Release

This option permanently deletes your release. This may be the setting you want to use if you want to clean up releases beyond simply [invalidating releases][invalidate-releases].

__Info:__ If you have a device [preloaded][preload-devices] with an OS version lower than 2.113.14 and a release, and you delete the release before provisioning the device, then when the device provisions it will be in a VPN-only state. To fix this, you must update the supervisor on the device to version 14.9.4 or higher.

# Configuration

Variables on the configuration page allow you to provide runtime configuration to the host OS and supervisor. These variables all begin with `{{ $names.company.allCaps}}_` or `RESIN_`. Beginning with supervisor v7.0.0, a number of them appear automatically in your dashboard when your device is provisioned.

Configuration can be managed at both the fleet and device level.

__Note:__ Configuration defined in the dashboard will not apply to devices in [local mode][local-mode].

## Variable list

Aside from [variables][variables], you can also configure device behavior with Supervisor or device type specific variables.

For a complete list of valid configuration variables that can be configured, check the [configuration list][configuration-list].

## Fleet configuration management

Configuration defined at the fleet level controls the behavior of any devices running in that fleet unless it is overridden with device configuration of the same name. If you want to change the default value for any of the pre-populated configuration, make sure you are in the *Configuration* tab on the fleet, then click *activate* for the variable you wish to define:

<img alt="Activate fleet level configuration" src="/img/configuration/activate_default_config.webp" width="100%">

After activating, the variable will be populated with the default value. Variables that can be enabled or disabled can be switched with the provided toggles. Other values can be edited by clicking the small edit (pencil) icon. To remove the fleet wide configuration, and reset it to its default value, click the delete (trash can) icon.

If you have already defined configuration at the device level, they will appear in a list below your fleet wide configuration. You can easily apply a device value to the entire fleet by clicking *Define fleet-wide*:

<img alt="Define device level configuration fleet-wide" src="/img/configuration/define_app_wide.webp" width="100%">

In order to delete device level overrides of a fleet wide configuration, click the "overrides" button in the list to delete device configuration for specific devices and enforce fleet wide configuration back on those device.

<img alt="Override device configuration" src="/img/configuration/override_config.webp" width="80%">

## Device configuration management

Device configuration defines the behavior of a single device. If both the fleet and the device have configuration of the same name, the code on the device will use the value given in the device configuration. In other words, device level configuration redefines (or overrides) fleet wide configuration.

The device level configuration list includes the pre-populated default values. Variables that can be enabled or disabled can be easily switched with the provided toggles. Other values can be edited by clicking the small edit (pencil) icon.

<img alt="Device configuration" src="/img/configuration/device_config_variables.webp" width="100%">

Clicking the small edit (pencil) icon will pop up a small dialog for editing the value:

<img alt="Edit device configuration" src="/img/configuration/edit_device_config.webp" width="80%">

To remove the device level configuration, and reset it to its default value, click the delete (trash can) icon.

## Overriding the splash screen

To replace the {{ $names.company.lower }} logo with your custom splash logo, go to your Fleet or Device `Configuration` page and find the configuration for `Define the PNG image to be used for the boot splash screen. Only supported by supervisor versions >= v12.3.0.`. Click `activate` to upload your image.

<img alt="Override the splash screen" src="/img/configuration/override_splash_screen_config.webp" />

## Adding custom configuration

The custom configuration section can be used to modify configuration options beyond the ones pre-populated for your device using the balenaCloud dashboard. Examples include, [modifying config.txt using configuration variables][boot-config-guide] for Raspberry Pi devices.

To define custom fleet wide configuration, scroll past the automatically populated options, then click the *Add custom configuration* button in the lower-right corner:

<img alt="Add custom fleet" src="/img/configuration/add_fleet_configuration.webp" width="100%">

A dialog pops up giving you the option to define a name and value (remember, all config variable names must begin with `{{ $names.company.allCaps}}_` or `RESIN_`). Click *Add* to apply:

<img alt="Add custom fleet configuration" src="/img/configuration/variable_editor_config.webp" width="80%">

Adding custom device configuration is similar to adding custom fleet configuration. You can override the value of custom fleet configuration by clicking *override* inside device configuration. This will pop up the variable editing dialog, where you can change the value:

<img alt="Add custom device configuration" src="/img/configuration/add_device_custom_variable.webp" width="100%">


__Note:__ In addition to the dashboard, this configuration can be also be set using the API or any of its clients, including the [SDK][sdk] and [CLI][cli].

# Device Logs

Device logging and the storage of device logs in {{ $names.cloud.lower }} is designed to be a debugging feature for balena devices. The Logs section in the balenaCloud dashboard can be used to view and download logs from the system and app services running on the device in real-time.

<img alt="Dashboard Logs" src="/img/common/main_dashboard/device_logs.webp">

## Device logs on the balenaCloud dashboard

Device logs contain anything written to stdout and stderr of app services and the system logs of the device. The dashboard allows logs to be cleared, filtered, searched, and viewed according to the browser timezone (or UTC).

The maximum limit of logs displayed on the dashboard is 1000 lines. This is also the amount of logs stored in the API and available for download. Device logging in balenaCloud isn't meant for long-term, reliable storage of logs. It's instead designed to provide the latest logs from the device for debugging purposes. We plan to expand our logging solution to offer long-term storage and search.

## Persistent logging

The ability to read logs from the different system services running in balenaOS is vital in tracking issues. On reboot, these journal logs are cleared, and so examining them will not, for example, give any insight as to why the reboot may have occurred (or which services may have failed, causing a reboot).
To alleviate this, balenaOS allows persistent journals (logs). Persistent logs provide vital insight into checking why a reboot occurred and help make debugging easier.

Persistent logging can be enabled using the Configuration tab on the sidebar for either a specific device or fleet-wide. Select 'Activate' to enable persistent logging on a specific device or on all devices in a fleet.
Since logs are stored in the data partition of the hostOS, the device(s) will reboot to activate persistent logging and apply the related settings.
Once persistent logging is enabled, the logs are stored as part of the data partition on the device (either on SD card, eMMC, hard disk, etc.). Logs are located on-device at `/var/log/journal/<uuid>`,where `<uuid>` matches the contents of the `/etc/machine-id` and is not related with the balena device UUID.

Journals can be read like those for any unit file, using journalctl, although the flags passed to the command are slightly different. Here's an example of how to read persistent journals:

```
root@dee2945:~# cd /var/log/journal/b9ccd869194e4f1381c06967f99b0265/

## Increasing size of persistent logs store

Depending on the OS version, the size of persistent logs can be increased to store more logs than the default size (32 MB currently). This can be done by adjusting the `SystemMaxUse=` setting in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/journald-balena-os.conf` (refer to [journald.conf docs](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html) for more information). Mistakes in the configuration can cause hard-to-solve problems, hence we recommend testing the changes on development test devices first.

We consider changes to the size of persistent log store to be a temporary debugging tool, not a long-term solution. In particular, changes made to `journald-balena-os.conf` will be overwritten when balenaOS is updated.

Do keep in mind persistent logging increases the wear on the storage medium due to increased writes. Refer to [long term storage of device logs](#long-term-device-logs-storage) for ways to offset this.

## Long term device logs storage

If you are dealing with excessive logs, persistent logging might not be a reliable long-term solution. Persistent logging increases writes on the device's storage media, which results in higher wear and tear over time.

Instead, device logs can be streamed using the supervisor API. Refer to the [Supervisor's journald](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/#journald-logs) endpoint. Through this endpoint, device logs can be streamed to whichever cloud monitoring platform you use to store logs reliably over time. For example, using a solution like [Datadog](https://www.balena.io/blog/iot-fleet-monitoring-with-datadog-and-balenacloud-how-small-agent-containers-make-a-big-impact/).

excerpt: Determine the status and connectivity of a device
---

# Device statuses

Device statuses are displayed on the Devices page and the Device Summary page. An overview of the device statuses of a fleet is shown on the Fleets page. Each device can have one of the following statuses:

| Status                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operational**                              | The device is functioning normally and communicating with the cloud within the expected time interval. In the standard configuration, this means both [cloudlink][cloudlink] and the device heartbeat API are working. If [cloudlink is disabled][bandwidth-reduction], the device will still appear `Operational` if the heartbeat API is functional.   |
| **Reduced Functionality**        | The device is connected to the backend but is experiencing limited functionality due to either **missing recent Heartbeat API communications** or **lack of connection to cloudlink**.                                                                                       |
| **Disconnected**                                  | The device is not connected to cloudlink and has not communicated via the Heartbeat API for a duration exceeding the [API polling interval][poll-interval]. This status indicates that the device is completely unable to send or receive any data from the balena cloud.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Configuring**                              | The device is applying OS configuration. For example, an OS upgrade.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Updating**                                 | The device is updating to a new App release. In future versions this will also reflect OS updates.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Post Provisioning**                        | The device has been [provisioned][device-provisioning] but has not yet been booted from its internal storage (e.g. eMMC or NVMe).                                                                                              |
| **Inactive**                                 | The device has been [deactivated][deactivated] or has been [preregistered][preregistered] but has not yet connected to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API.                         |
| **Frozen**                                   | The device has been frozen because it's outside the organization's allowance, or is in a paid [fleet type][fleet type] on a free tier organization.                              |


## Device Connectivity states



The balena device uses two mechanisms to maintain communication with balenaCloud, namely a periodic HTTP API heartbeat and a VPN based tunnel called cloudlink. The state of both of these links can be seen in the device listing.

![Device connectivity indicators](/img/common/main_dashboard/device_status.webp)

`Reduced Functionality` indicates that the device is experiencing limited connectivity. This can be due to either **missing recent Heartbeat API communications** or **lack of connection to cloudlink**. The boolean columns for these states are as follows:

- **Cloudlink available, but heartbeat not**: The device is unable to communicate with the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API. A device with cloudlink only is not able to apply any new changes made such as deploying new releases, applying service configuration values, or switching to local mode. However, since cloudlink is available, the device is accessible via SSH or the web terminal. When a device exhibits this state, the first troubleshooting step is to [run a healthcheck](https://docs.balena.io/reference/diagnostics/#device-health-checks) and pull [device diagnostics](https://docs.balena.io/reference/diagnostics/#device-diagnostics). This should help determine the reason the supervisor is not communicating with the balenaCloud backend.

- **Heartbeat available, but Cloudlink not**: The device is unable to connect to Cloudlink (e.g. a firewall is blocking VPN traffic). [Features enabled by Cloudlink][cloudlink] such as [SSH access][ssh-access] will not be available. A device with Heartbeat Only status has internet connectivity, is able to reach the API, and can poll the cloud for new updates to apply, but actions that take immediate effect, such as purging data, restarting services, rebooting or shutting down, will not be available as they are performed via Cloudlink.

__Note:__ If the device is powered off or loses all network connectivity, the `heartbeat` indicator will show as connected (green) until enough time has passed to cover the device [API polling interval][poll-interval], at which time it will be marked as `Disconnected`.


## Update statuses

The `Update status` and `Update status duration` fields on devices represent the state of the current application update to target state. 

__Note:__ Data for these states will only get populated for devices with [supervisor 16.7.0](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1670) or later.

| Status                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Done**                              | The update, restart or configuration change is complete and the device is in its target state.                                          |
| **Downloading**                       | The supervisor is downloading one or more container images associated with the target release                                           |
| **Downloaded**                        | All container images in the target release have been downloaded. **Note:** If the device holds an update lock, it will stop in this state until the lock is released (depending on the [update strategy](https://docs.balena.io/learn/deploy/release-strategy/update-strategies/#controlling-the-update-strategy)). |
| **Applying Changes**                  | The supervisor is performing actions to install the new release, i.e. killing old containers and making volumes/network/container changes.    |
| **Rejected**                          | The target release has required services that do not meet the [necessary requirements](https://docs.balena.io/learn/develop/multicontainer/#container-requirements) to run. |
| **Aborted**                           | The supervisor has given up on trying to install a new release. There are currently no conditions under which the supervisor returns this state, but future work could allow the supervisor to abort an update, for instance, after a number of failed download tries.    |

## Update Status Duration

This field is calculated based on the timestamp of the most recent update event. For example: In the screenshot above for Device Connectivity states, the device `bitter-wind` shows an update status duration of 17 minutes. This signifies that the device update status changed to `Downloaded` 17 minutes ago, which was the most recent update event. This value will reset when the update status changes again for the device. When querying this data from the API, you will receive a timestamp instead of a duration.

It is important to note that when the application starts up after a reboot or an app restart, this behavior is indistinguishable from an app installation. Consequently, the `Update Status Duration` timestamp will be refreshed whenever a reboot or restart occurs.

## Statuses and OS upgrades

The `Update status` currently focuses on application updates, and for the time being OS updates are still reflected as part of the device status. When a device is performing an OS update, the status will change to `Configuring` with additional details in parentheses, such as `Configuring (Update successful, rebooting)`. While filtering or searching based on the data in parentheses is not yet available, we are working towards unifying all update paths under the `Update Status` mechanism used by applications. This will make it even easier to track and manage updates in the future.

# Filters and tags

## Device filters

As the number of devices in your fleet grows, the device list will become increasingly busy. Filters provide a convenient way to quickly find specific devices based on shared characteristics.

### Add and update filters

To add a filter, click the *Add filter* button near the top-left corner of your fleet page. You'll be presented with a window to configure your filter:

<img src="/img/common/app/add-filter.webp" width="80%">

The first dropdown lists the device characteristics you can filter on. These characteristics correspond to the columns in your device list. The second dropdown contains comparison operators appropriate to the device characteristic, such as `is`, `is before`, `contains`, and `matches RegEx`. The third field is where you specify a value to filter on.

__Note:__ When filtering by [device tags][tags], you can filter by name, value, or both.

Click *Add filter* to apply your configuration.

When your filter has been added, you will see it in a box above the device list. The device list will now only show devices that match your filter:

<img src="/img/common/app/filter-applied.webp" width="80%">

If you need to update your filter, simply click it and a new configuration window will appear. To remove, click the `x` to the filter's right. You can add any number of additional filters with the *Add filter* button.

### Create a view

When you create a view, you are saving a specific set of filters that you may want to use again. To do this, click *Save view* on the right side of the filter box:

<img src="/img/common/app/save-view.webp" width="80%">

You will be asked to choose a name for the saved view. This view can then be selected at any time by clicking the *Views* button above the filter box.

## Device tags

Tags provide an easy way to include more information about your devices than what is already provided in the dashboard. With tags, you have the option to create key:value pairs that extend the available metadata for your devices. A device can be given multiple tags, and the tags can be used when you create [filters][filters].

### Create and edit tags

To add a tag from the device list, click the checkbox to the left of the devices you wish to tag, followed by the *Tags* button on the right side of the dashboard:

<img src="/img/common/app/tags.webp" width="80%">

You can also manage tags from a device's summary page. The *Manage Tags* option is available in the action dropdown to the right of the *Reboot* and *Restart* buttons:

<img src="/img/common/app/device_manage_tags.webp" width="40%">

Both of these options will open the tag management window, from which you can define a name for your tag. Note that tag names cannot be empty, cannot contain spaces, and cannot use the reserved `io.{{ $names.company.short }}` prefix. In addition to a name, you can define a value, although this is optional.

__Note:__ A device cannot have more than one tag with the same name, even if the values are different. If you create a new tag with the same name as an existing tag, the existing tag will be replaced.

This example shows how you could create a tag to keep track of device location:

<img src="/img/common/app/add_tag.webp" width="80%">

Tags you add to your device will appear in a list in the management window. They can be edited or removed from here:

<img src="/img/common/app/tag_list.webp" width="80%">

When you are finished creating and editing tags, click *Apply* to keep the changes.

__Note:__ Device tags can also be created and managed programmatically [via the API][api-example].

### Tag columns

Once tags have been added to at least one device, a new *All Tags* column will appear on the right side of the device table:

<img src="/img/common/app/all_tags.webp" width="80%">

This column can be hidden by clicking the arrow on the far right of the device table header. You can also add columns for specific tags by selecting *Add Tag Column*:

<img src="/img/common/app/add_tag_column.webp" width="25%">

A new column will be created. You can then select which tag it should display:

<img src="/img/common/app/tag_column.webp" width="25%">

# Variables

Variables allow you to provide runtime configuration to one or more running services without having to modify your source code. Variables can be added onto the device using the balenaCloud dashboard and can be assigned to either a specific service or all services running on the device. You can use variables to store secrets and other sensitive values out of your codebase and configure them when needed from the dashboard.
 
Variables defined in the dashboard are exposed on the device as environment variables and can be accessed within the service or services that they were defined for as shown below:
 
<img alt="Accessing variable" src="/img/variables/accessing_variables.webp">

Variables can be applied at the fleet or the individual device level through the Variables page. You can apply Variables to the entire fleet by navigating to the Variables page for that fleet. Adding or modifying a fleet variable for all services will restart all services on the device. Similarly, changing device variables defined only for a specific service will only restart the affected service.

Values defined for individual devices always override those defined for the fleet. Values defined for specific services would override variables defined at the same level (Fleet or device level). So for any given variable, the **device service specific variable** will always have the top priority, followed by the **device variable for all services**, then the **fleet service specific variable**, and finally the **fleet variable for all services**.

__Note:__ Any variables defined through the dashboard do not apply to devices in [local mode][local-mode].

Values can be up to 1MB (or approximately 1 million characters) in size each. A device will re-download the variables every time the state changes in the API, which may potentially result in a lot of [network traffic][bandwidth-control]. The interval can be configured with the [BALENA_SUPERVISOR_POLL_INTERVAL configuration variable][poll-interval].

## Fleet-wide variables

Variables defined at the fleet level are available to all devices in that fleet unless they are redefined with a variable of the same name at the device level.

Fleet-wide variables can be found from the Fleet Summary page by clicking the *Variables* tab.

To define a new variable, click the *Add variable* button in the upper-left corner.

<img alt="Add variable" src="/img/variables/add_fleet_variable.webp" width="80%">

In the dialog box that opens, select either 'All services' or a specific service to which the variable will be applied.

Define a name and value for your variable. Click the *Add* button to apply the variable to all devices in your fleet that do not have their own values defined:

<img alt="Add variable" src="/img/variables/variable_editor.webp" width="80%">

Your new variable will show up in the list, where it can easily be modified or removed. Adding or modifying fleet variables will trigger restart of all services on the device.

<img alt="List variables" src="/img/variables/variable_list.webp" width="100%">

__Note:__ Deleting a fleet-level variable will not delete a device-level variable of the same name.

If you have already defined variables at the device level, they will appear below the fleet variables of the same type. You can easily apply a device value to the entire fleet by clicking *Define fleet-wide*:

<img alt="Define device variable fleet-wide" src="/img/variables/define_app_wide.webp" width="100%">

## Device Variables

Device variables are applied to only one device. Device variables for a specific service override device variables for all services, and all device variables override fleet-wide variables.

Adding a device variable is very similar to adding a fleet variable. From the Device Summary page, select *Device Variables* to open the variables page. Click *Add variable* to select the appropriate service or all services if necessary. Add a name and a value for the variable you wish to apply, and click the *Add* button to add the variable.

The variable list will include variables defined for that specific device, as well as any fleet variables of the same type:

<img alt="Device variables" src="/img/variables/device_variables.webp" width="100%">

You can override the value of a fleet variable by clicking *override* in the far-right column. This will pop up the variable editing dialog, where you can change the value:

<img alt="Add device variable" src="/img/variables/override.webp" width="80%">

Changing a variable defined only for a specific service will only restart the affected service.

## Managing with the CLI & SDK

The {{ $names.company.lower }} CLI and SDKs all include methods to easily read, add or update variables. Consult the appropriate reference for code examples.

title: Development Anti-patterns

# Anti-patterns, or how to break your {{ $names.os.lower }} devices

As you are building your fleet and preparing for production, there are a number of things to keep in mind that can cause problems on a device. Many of these items may seem obvious or even desired, but often cause more trouble than they are worth.

## Networking
One of the biggest causes of issues during deployment is either a misconfigured local network or otherwise a network that does not adhere to the {{ $names.os.lower }} [networking requirements][networking-reqs].

### Connectivity dependent on container (e.g. kernel module for wifi dongle, or udev rule for modem)
Since there can be cases where containers fail to start, having any networking configuration depend on those containers without a fallback is generally discouraged. Using a project like [wifi-connect][wifi-connect] can help configure the networking stack after launch, but devices should be connected as reliably as possible at boot.

### Iptables rules that block supervisor/cloudlink traffic
it is enticing to use custom iptables rules to filter traffic, to limit the surface of the api. those rules combined with host networking however can prevent the supervisor or cloudlink from successfully connecting to {{ $names.cloud.lower }}, and therefore should be treated with caution. for a full list of networking requirements, consult [this document][networking-reqs].

### Manually changing the system clock, or blocking NTP requests
Since {{ $names.os.lower }} and the supervisor communicate with {{ $names.cloud.lower }} using an HTTPS API, it is important that time is synchronized on the device. If the system date/time drifts substantially, SSL certificate validation may fail and the device may unexpectedly lose the ability to reach HTTPS websites or update the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} web dashboard, and may even no longer be reachable over ssh or cloudlink. {{ $names.os.upper }} provides a [number of mechanisms][time-sync] to keep time as up-to-date as possible, but ensuring [NTP is accessible over the network][networking-reqs] is critical.

## Local storage

### Writing to files in the container file system (and not a volume)
Commonly, users misunderstand the distinction between the container's file system and a volume. Named volumes are preserved across updates unless specifically dereferenced or destroyed, while anything written to the container's file system will be purged during updates to new releases. In addition, the container's file system often uses the AUFS driver, which typically has worse performance both in disk space and CPU utilization when compared to a named volume's standard Linux ext4 file system. For an in-depth comparison of the two, it is recommended to complete the following [services masterclass][services-mc]. Additionally, the [supervisor provides an API][supervisor-api] to manage named volumes.

### Running out of disk space
One of the most common issues moving from a project to a product is considering what is written to local disk. Often, either logs or important data are written locally but without giving thought to the data's lifecycle. It is important to ensure that some mitigations are in place to prevent any local storage from filling. [Some examples include][logging-solutions]:
* configuring logrotate
* external logging service
* logging only to stderr/stdout to take advantage of {{ $names.engine.lower }}'s built-in logging features

If the data partition (`/mnt/data`) fills up completely, {{ $names.engine.lower }} may not be able to restart the container on device reboot, new releases may fail to apply, and the only way to recover the device may be by deleting the image through manual intervention, including loss of all data written to the container's file system (named volumes are preserved).

### Excessive writes causing SD / Flash failure / corruption
If the device type uses flash memory or an SD card, any write-heavy workload will cause that storage medium to wear prematurely and may cause devices to crash irrecoverably. Limiting any writing to temporary locations in-memory is one strategy to avoid having to replace SD cards in the field. There are further SD card recommendations [available here][sd-cards]

## Host OS services

### Modifying the OS image
Any modifications made to the host OS before flashing or at runtime carry undue risk. If the host OS has been modified in some way (other than connection details), any subsequent behavior cannot be guaranteed.

### Modifying the host’s systemd services via D-Bus
While {{ $names.os.lower }} provides lots of flexibility in terms of interacting with the host OS via D-Bus, with great power comes great responsibility. Since these interactions can potentially cause {{ $names.os.lower }} devices to disconnect from {{ $names.cloud.lower }} or even fall offline, these API calls should be carefully guarded and carefully considered.

### DoSing the supervisor with API requests
Since the supervisor is the brain of the update process for {{ $names.os.lower }} devices, any interactions with the API provided should be carefully considered and rate-limited. If a container engages in denial-of-service style behavior, the supervisor may be unable to recover and perform any necessary updates.

### Incorrect config.txt/config.json settings
These two configuration files are critical for the boot process on most devices. Specifically, a malformed `config.json` will cause any {{ $names.os.lower }} devices to not boot properly, and a mangled `config.txt` (on certain Raspberry Pi-based devices) may cause a loss in functionality at boot. There are some tools that can help manage these files across devices, like [configizer][configizer] and [dtparam tuneables][dtparams].

## Managing Resources

### Creating a reboot loop
One common anti-pattern is to trigger reboots if some condition is met (using the supervisor API or D-Bus directly). Often this "fix" can cause reboot loops that are unexpected and cause more trouble than they fix. Nearly all components of {{ $names.os.lower }} are health-checked and restarted if found to be non-functional, including the [operating system itself][watchdog] (when available).

### Causing an out-of-memory (OOM) scenario
When developing on low-footprint devices or for a heterogeneous fleet, it is easy to forget about managing memory consumption. Due to the nature of [Linux's out-of-memory killer][linux-oom], these events are often difficult to catch and debug. Individual services can be limited by {{ $names.engine.lower }} using [directives in `docker-compose.yml`][docker-compose].

## Managing Fleets

### Not pinning base image versions
It is important to make a conscious decision regarding pinning a container's base image to a specific version, for example:

```
FROM debian:bookworm-20250428
```

instead of:

```
FROM debian:bookworm
```

During app development, pinning versions of various components as much as possible prevents pieces from changing unintentionally later on during a redeployment when new versions are silently pulled in (like libraries, OS versions, base images, etc). In the same vein, pinning versions encourages builder cache reuse as components cannot change underneath the build process itself, ensuring a more reliable and repeatable build.

title: Collected Data
---
# Data collected by {{ $names.company.lower }}

In order to make data driven decisions, {{ $names.company.lower }} collects usage related events via a 3rd party 
analytics service, [Amplitude][amplitude]. These events provide us context on the state of container execution steps. This 
way we could observe the health of fleets in {{ $names.cloud.lower }} ecosystem and analyze the potential problems as 
well as trends.

## User data collected by {{ $names.company.lower }}

{{ $names.company.lower }} collects information about CLI and web dashboard usage behavior.
User data we process includes

* user name (login) and the email address used to log into the system,
* device type, operating system and browser versions,
* device screen size,
* IP address,
* referrer to {{ $names.company.lower }} sites,
* company user belongs to (when web dashboard is used only).

Please note that {{ $names.company.lower }} does not collect information about end users of devices managed with
{{ $names.company.lower }} platform, i.e. information about our customer users is not collected or processed.
We work only with data collected for users who use {{ $names.company.lower }} to manage their device fleets.

## {{ $names.etcher.lower }}

{{ $names.etcher.lower }} is an application maintained by {{ $names.company.lower }} team that can be used to easily
flash OS images to SD cards and USB drives. If user does not opt out from collecting the analytics data, the application
tracks its usage. In addition to the data described above, information about the type of SD cards and USB drives is
collected too.

## Device data collected by the supervisor

Data are submitted to Amplitude from {{ $names.company.lower }}-managed devices on the events listed in
the table below. Submitted packets [may contain][supervisor-data-mask] the following information:

* Fleet ID and name
* Docker image hash
* Service ID, name, labels
* Release ID and/or git commit hash used to make the release
* Device IP address (as reported in {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard)
* OS and supervisor versions
* Error root cause message (in case of error events)
* Timing info about device management operations (see event names)

## Data collected automatically by Amplitude
Amplitude library generates a unique identifier for each device that sends an event.
We associate the events with the device UUID provided by {{ $names.cloud.lower }} as well.
Besides these identifiers, we don’t send any other user ID to Amplitude.

Amplitude library automatically extracts geographical location data from the device’s IP address,
so it collects city, region and country information.
See more in a [relevant article by Amplitude][amplitude-auto-collection].

## About logging
Logs produced by the releases deployed to the devices via {{ $names.company.lower }} supervisor application
can be streamed to web dashboard or CLI user who has permissions to view them through our cloud.
However, the logs are stored in the cloud temporarily only in order to allow the streaming
functionality - {{ $names.company.lower }} does not process device application logs unless technical support is
requested by our users.

# Balena Glossary


The glossary is a quick reference tool for important terms, concepts and phrasing used at balena. This includes both balena-specific and general terminology that's commonly used in and across balena.

Is there a word or term that's missing? Does a definition need reworking or further clarity? Additions and improvements to the glossary are encouraged! You can either add these yourself or open a issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/issues/new).

> Make sure an entry is comprised of the word / acronym or phrase, whether it's a balena specific term or not, brief description and (when possible) a link to further reading / single source of truth for that definition.

An app is a coherent combination of services (blocks or other software) which will produce something useful for someone, it's ready to be deployed on a device / fleet.

### Assume Positive Intent
As we're a remote first company that communicates asynchronously across keyboards and screen the majority of the time, social cues, context and body language aren't present to help with understanding each other. We try to stick to 'assume positive intent' when trying to understand how we're communicating with each other. E.g. not using an emoji doesn't mean they're annoyed at you.

### AUFS

### Deltas
**(balena specific term)** Deltas is a balenaCloud feature that enables users to minimize network bandwidth usage and associated costs when deploying new releases to their fleets, by letting devices download the absolute minimum amount of data. From a technical perspective it works as follows: the *delta server*, a backend component of balenaCloud, computes on-demand the binary difference between the images in the new release and the release the fleet is currently running, and the *Supervisor* on a device applies this difference locally by, effectively, mutating its local images. Under a few conditions, deltas are also generated by the *builder* when it builds a new release.

# Network debugging

There are some common networking issues that can stop several major components
(VPN, Supervisor, balenaEngine) from working correctly.

The first thing to check would be confirming if the [networking requirements](https://docs.balena.io/reference/OS/network/2.x/#network-requirements) are being met.

Additionally, services running on the device themselves may have networking requirements
which may not be met. For example, a service may need to send data to a server, but the
server is offline and unreachable, and maybe the service isn't designed to handle these failures.

In general, debugging networking issues also gets easier the more you experiment 
with making changes to networking interfaces and routes on a device. The following
sections describe some of the more common network failure modes, as well as how to
track them down. Be aware that several of these problems may also occur at the same
time, with one problem causing others to appear. For example, NTP failure could stop
the date from being correct, which can lead to the VPN failing to connect (as the 
certificate is probably not yet date-valid) as well as the Supervisor failing to
download updates (for the same reason).

#### 6.1 NTP Failure

Service: `chronyd.service`
CLI: `chronyc`

Network Time Protocol is important because it allows devices without RTCs
(Real-Time Clocks) to retrieve the correct date and time from Internet based
servers that run on an extremely fine granularity. At first glance, this may
not seem significant, but devices such as the Raspberry Pi do not include an
RTC and so when balenaOS is first booted, it sets the time when the
release of the OS was built. Clearly, this could be days, weeks, months or
even years behind the current time. Because almost all the balena services
that work with applications work with balenaCloud endpoints, it is extremely
important that the date and time be set correctly, else SSL-based connections
(including HTTPS connections) will be rejected because the certificates
presented will appear to be date invalid when compared to the system clock.

Depending on how skewed the device date is from the real date, this can manifest
as several different issues:

- Refusal to connect to the balenaCloud VPN
- Refusal to download configuration from the API
- Refusal by the Supervisor to download the latest release

Examining the status of the `chronyd` service can show these symptoms, along
with the simple `date` command:

```shell
root@9294512:~# date
Fri Aug 19 09:11:43 UTC 2022
```

If the date reported by the device differs to the current date and time, then
there is most probably a problem with the time service.

Before continuing with this exercise, reboot or power down/power up and wait
for it to come online before SSHing into it.

Ensure you know the local IP address of the debug device (or use `balena scan`
to find the hostname of your device), and SSH into it like this (where
`10.0.0.197` is the IP address of your device, or `<host>.local` name):

```shell
$ balena ssh 10.0.0.197
Last login: Fri Aug 19 09:09:37 2022
root@9294512:~#
```

Your device should be connected, bring up the Dashboard page for the device.
It should be 'Online' and running the pushed release code.

We'll demonstrate an NTP failure by making some manual changes to the date:

```shell
root@9294512:~# date -s "23 MAR 2017 12:00:00"
Thu Mar 23 12:00:00 UTC 2017
root@9294512:~# systemctl restart openvpn
```

Almost immediately, you'll see that the device status moves to 'Online (Heartbeat only)'. So,
why has this happened? Wait until the device comes back online, then ssh back in and take a look in the OpenVPN logs:

```shell
root@9294512:~# journalctl --follow -n 300 -u openvpn.service

There's a bit to wade through here, but the first line shows the OpenVPN
successfully finalizing a connection to the balenaCloud VPN backend. However,
we then see our manual restart of the `openvpn.service` unit file
(`Mar 23 12:00:06 9294512 openvpn[2639]: Thu Mar 23 12:00:06 2017 SIGTERM[hard,] received, process exiting`)
and then it starting up again. But whilst it initializes, you'll note that
whilst trying to connect it found a problem in the verification stage:

```shell
Aug 18 10:51:45 9294512 openvpn[2639]: Thu Aug 18 10:51:45 2022 VERIFY OK: depth=0, C=US, ST=WA, L=Seattle, O=balena.io, OU=balenaCloud, CN=vpn.balena-cloud.com

```

The certificate that it fetched from the balenaCloud VPN service is not yet
valid. This is because SSL certificates have "valid from" and "valid to"
dates. These ensure that they can only be used in a particular time window, and
if the current time falls outside of that window then any connection using them
is invalid. In this case, because we've set the time back to 2017, the date
doesn't fall within that window and the connection is aborted by the client.

But if the date is incorrect, why has the device reconnected?
Run the following on the device:

```shell
root@9294512:~# date
Fri Aug 19 09:25:45 UTC 2022
```

So the date's actually now correct. This is because the NTP service
(`chronyd.service`) has eventually noticed that there's a mismatch in the
set time on the device, and the time from one of it's sources. Let's look at
the journal for it:

```shell
root@9294512:~# journalctl --no-pager -u chronyd.service

```

As you can see, it selected a source and set the time back to the correct
current time. This had a knock on effect, in that the openvpn service (VPN/cloudlink)
reattempted to connect to the backend:

```shell
root@9294512:~# journalctl -f -n 100 -u openvpn

```

This time the connection has been verified and the device has come online. This
shows what might have happened if someone had manually set the date, but what
happens if it doesn't recover? This is a good example of where the NTP port
might have been blocked, so that the device couldn't sync it's time. It might
also be possible that the `chronyd.service` unit may have crashed or stopped
for some reason, and restarting it would solve the issue.

Changes such as this don't just affect the online status of the device. Let's
stop the chrony service completely (so it can't correctly resync the time) and
change the date again:

```shell
root@9294512:~# systemctl stop chronyd.service
root@9294512:~# date -s "23 MAR 2017 12:00:00"
```

Now from your development machine, again push the source code from the
`multicontainer-app` directory:

```shell
$ balena push DebugFleet
```

Once the build has completed, the device should try and download the updated
release. However, you'll notice that the download doesn't start and
no changes are made. The Dashboard stays static. Why is this? Well as you've
probably guessed, it's for the same reasons that the VPN connection doesn't
work. Run the following on your device:

```shell
root@9294512:~# journalctl -n 100 --no-pager -u balena-supervisor
-- Journal begins at Thu 2017-03-23 12:00:00 UTC, ends at Fri 2022-08-19 09:33:22 UTC. --

Mar 23 12:00:06 9294512 balena-supervisor[6890]: [info]    VPN connection is not active.
```

As you can see, the certificate is again not valid as the current device time
does not fall within the validity window, and so the Supervisor won't pull the
latest release. If we restart chrony, this will be rectified and the
Supervisor will, after a short delay, start the update:

```shell
root@9294512:~# systemctl start chronyd.service
root@9294512:~# journalctl -f -u balena-supervisor
-- Journal begins at Thu 2017-03-23 12:00:20 UTC. --

```

This shows the importance of a working service such as timesetting, and how this
can affect the system as a whole. As a note, be aware that not _every_ device
relies completely on NTP. Some devices, such as an Intel NUC, also have battery
backed services including an RTC, which means that even if NTP is not working
the time may look at first glance as though it's correct. However, if NTP is
not operational even an RTC will eventually suffer from clock skew (the slow
movement away from the real time due to drift) which will eventually cause
issues.

`chronyc` is a command-line utility that can be used to interoperate with the
NTP daemon. `chronyc` has many commands, the most useful are:

- `sources` - A list of all the current NTP sources being used by the NTP
  daemon.
- `reselect` - Forces the NTP daemon to reselect the best time synchronization
  source.
- `tracking` - Information about the system clock itself, including skew.
- `ntpdata` - Detailed information on all the current NTP sources.

#### 6.2 DNS Issues

Service: `dnsmasq.service`

DNS (Domain Name Service) functionality allows the IP address of a hostname to
be retrieved for use by anything that uses endpoints on the Internet (that
isn't specified by an IP address). Any executable that uses a hostname to
make a connection to that host always uses DNS to get the IP address to make
that connection.

For this reason, DNS is vital in the reliable operation of a balena device as it
provides the ability to lookup `*.balena-cloud.com` hostnames to allow the
download of releases, reporting the device state, connection to the VPN,
etc.

DNS is provided by the `dnsmasq.service` unit, which uses a default
configuration located at `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` and a list of nameservices
in `/etc/resolv.dnsmasq`. This itself is derived from the
`/var/run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager` file.

The DNSMasq service runs at local address `127.0.0.2`. This is used, because
it allows customer services to provide their own DNS if required
and therefore does not clash with them.

By default, the external name servers used are the Google primary and secondary
at `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`. However, these can be overridden by modifying the
`/mnt/boot/config.json` file and adding a `dnsServers` property, with a comma
separated list of the IP addresses of the nameservers to use (see
[the docs](https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena#dnsservers) for more
information).

SSH into your device using it's local IP address:

```shell
$ balena ssh 10.0.0.197
```

or using it's UUID:

```shell
$ balena ssh 9294512
```

We're going to modify the DNS servers to point at one that doesn't exist,
just to show what happens. SSH into your device as above, then run the
following:

```shell
root@9294512:~# jq '.dnsServers = "1.2.3.4"' /mnt/boot/config.json > /mnt/data/config.json && mv /mnt/data/config.json /mnt/boot/config.json
root@9294512:~# mount -o remount,rw /
root@9294512:~# mv /etc/resolv.dnsmasq /etc/resolv.dnsmasq.moved
root@9294512:~# sync
root@9294512:~# reboot
```

This will move the default DNSMasq resolver config file, so that it's not
picked up. Additionally, it will modify the configuration to set the nameserver
to use as `1.2.3.4`. As this isn't a valid nameserver, nothing will get the
right address to make connections. Note that usually, remounting the root FS
as writeable is a very risky move, and should not be carried out without good
reason!

After a while, once the device has rebooted, SSH back into the device using the local IP address, and look
at the `dnsmasq.service` unit:

```shell
root@9294512:~# systemctl status dnsmasq
● dnsmasq.service - DNS forwarder and DHCP server

```

As you can see, it's tried, and failed to get the `/etc/resolv.dnsmasq` file
and has just the one nameserver to use, `1.2.3.4`.

Now let's look at the Supervisor:

```

As you can see, the Supervisor is not at all happy, unable to connect to the API
and failing to get the current target state. This is because it is unable to get
an IP address for `api.balena-cloud.com`.

Worst still, OpenVPN will not be able to resolve the VPN hostname, and so the
device will have dropped 'Offline' (check the Dashboard or use `balena devices`)
to verify this.

Many other services will be in the same state. A good test of whether DNS is
working is to try to get to a known service on the internet, including
balenaCloud and Google:

```shell
root@9294512:~# curl https://google.com
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: google.com
root@9294512:~# curl https://api.balena-cloud.com/ping
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: api.balena-cloud.com
```

Both of these should succeed if DNS is working, but as you can see, both give
a `Could not resolve host` error. This is an extremely good pointer that DNS
is failing.

One thing to be aware of is that sometimes DNS fails not because of an invalid
server, but because the traffic for port 53 (the DNS port) is being firewalled
(see later section).

For now, we're going to put the DNS service back how it should be:

```shell
root@9294512:~# mount -o remount,rw /
root@9294512:~# mv /etc/resolv.dnsmasq.moved /etc/resolv.dnsmasq
root@9294512:~# jq -M 'del(.dnsServers)' /mnt/boot/config.json > /mnt/data/config.json && mv /mnt/data/config.json /mnt/boot/config.json
root@9294512:~# sync
root@9294512:~# reboot
```

This will put the device back into its previously working DNS state, and it
will reconnect to the network.

#### 6.3 OpenVPN

Services: `openvpn.service`, `os-config.service`

Device connections to balenaCloud vary depending on the operation being
carried out, for example registering the device is carried out by the Supervisor
contacting the API endpoint directly.

However, a large part of the cloud-to-device functionality is tunneled by the
balena VPN. This include various data such as the device status, actions,
SSH access, public URLs etc.

Initially, the `os-config.service` unit requests a block of configuration data
from the API, once the device has been registered against the fleet. Let's
have a look at the journal output from a device that's been freshly provisioned
and started for the first time:

```shell
root@f220105:~# journalctl -f -n 300 -u os-config
-- Journal begins at Fri 2021-08-06 14:40:59 UTC. --
Aug 06 14:41:03 localhost os-config[1610]: Fetching service configuration from https://api.balena-cloud.com/os/v1/config...

Aug 19 10:24:11 f220105 os-config[1610]: Starting balena-supervisor.service...
...
```

You can see that, once registered, the `os-config` service requested the
configuration for the device from the API, received it, and then used the
returned data to:

1. Stop the Supervisor.
2. Write the new OpenVPN configuration to the state partition.
3. Write the correct root CA for the VPN to the state partition.
4. Restarted the OpenVPN service.
5. Updated the authorized keys.

**Quick Note:** Customers can also specify their own keys to access devices
(both development and production) in a couple of ways. The first is adding
an `os.sshKeys[]` property, which is an array of public keys, to the
`/mnt/boot/config.json` file. There is also upcoming support for user
custom keys being added to the API backend.

As you can see, the OpenVPN configuration and Certificate Authority certificate
is fetched from the API and not baked in. This allows balena to update their
certificates, configurations and keys on the fly, ensuring we can tailor the
VPN for the best possible experience and security. However, this does require
that the API endpoint is available to periodically refresh the config.

So, what happens if the API _isn't_ available? If this occurs on first boot,
then the device wouldn't be able to register, so there wouldn't be a
configuration to fetch for it.

On subsequent boots, the API not being initially available isn't as much of an
issue, because there is already a configuration and certificate for the VPN
which can be used until `os-config` can contact the API to check for new
configurations (and it is unlikely to have changed in the meantime).

Let's now look at the current OpenVPN journal entries on your device. SSH into
the device:

```shell
$ balena ssh 10.0.0.197

```

The first part of the journal shows that the device has initiated contact with
the VPN backend, accepted the certificate passed to it, and then started the
initialisation of the VPN. We've cut some option stuff out, but the final lines
state `Initialization Sequence Completed` which is the sign the VPN is up
and running.

There are some things that can affect the VPN. As we saw when discussing NTP,
an incorrect time might force the VPN to reject the server certificate, as it
wouldn't be in a valid time window.

Additionally, other things that might affect the VPN include the firewalling
of non-HTTPS traffic (the VPN uses port 443 as well), the inability to retrieve
an initial configuration/CA certificate and Deep Packet Inspection routers that
require alternative certificates (we'll go into this later).

Another stumbling block is that if there are VPN issues then this usually means
the VPN isn't working, which means the device is not able to go into
an 'Online' state, and thus SSHing from the balena CLI or the Dashboard is not
possible. In these cases, your best hope is that there is another balena device
that is on the same network, to use as a gateway to the failing device (See:
[4. Accessing a Device using a Gateway Device](#4-accessing-a-device-using-a-gateway-device)).
If every balena device on the network is failing to connect to the VPN, this
usually indicates the network is being overly restrictive, which becomes a
customer issue.

#### 6.4 Firewalled Endpoints

Balena devices work on a variety of networks, but they do require the basic
networking environment as listed in
[6. Determining Networking Issues](#6-determining-networking-issues).

Firewalls are a sensible precaution in any network, be they personal or
corporate. A large number of firewalls are built to provide freedom for devices
to initiate connections to an outgoing connection on the wider Internet (where
a device _in_ the network can create a connection and receive all data from
the Internet based on that connection), but to refuse any incoming connection
from the Internet, unless specifically allowed.

On that note, firewalls can include blocklists and allowlists.
Most industrial routers and firewalls blocklist everything by default,
requiring a set of allowlist IPs and domain names where traffic can be
sent/received from.

However, firewalling on some networks can be very aggressive, where without
any allowlisting all outgoing and incoming traffic is blocked. Usually, what
occurs is that a set list of known ports are allowed to outgoing traffic (and
incoming traffic on those connections), but no other traffic is allowed.
This is usually tailored by SREs/IT professionals to follow the 'normal' use
of nodes on those networks. However, balena devices are sometimes put into
these networks and due to the nature of their network requirements, deviate
from the 'normal' usage.

Sometimes firewalls can be diagnosed very easily. If a customer has a set of
devices on the same network, and they've never come online on that network,
it's a fair assumption that a firewall is blocking a required port or ports,
and that no traffic is able to make its way out of (or into) the network.

However, sometimes things are slightly more subtle. For example, we've
demonstrated what happens when the NTP service is blocked, and the time is
greatly skewed. This is sometimes because the network's firewall might be
blocking any traffic from/to port 123 (NTP's default port). The same is
true for SSL traffic (on port 443).

This can sometimes include traffic to a customer's cloud service. For example,
imagine that all the balena requirements are met, so that the device appears
to be operating normally, but a customer complains that their device seems
to not be able to contact their own cloud servers. It could be that the firewall
lets through all the traffic required by balena, but is blocking other arbitrary
ports, which might include the ports required by a service on the device.

These are all points which a support engineer should be aware of when
investigating a device that is showing abnormal behavior which might be related
to a network.

There are some very simple tests that can be carried out to see if most of the
network requirements are satisfied:

- `curl` to the API (`curl https://api.balena-cloud.com/ping`) and VPN
  (`curl https://cloudlink.balena-cloud.com/ping` or `curl https://vpn.balena-cloud.com/ping`) endpoints to see if a connection
  is attempted (in the latter case, you'll get an error, but shouldn't get
  a 'Not found' or 'Timeout' error)
- Check `chronyd.service` to see when it last updated
- Ensure that DNS is working (again a `curl` to the API endpoint will show if
  name resolution is working or not)
- Ensure that the registry endpoint is not blocked. This will exhibit as the
  Supervisor being unable to instruct balenaEngine to pull a release's
  service images. A manual attempt at `balena pull <imageDetails>` should
  allow you to see whether any connection is made, or whether it timeouts/
  disconnects.

##### 6.4.1 Deep Packet Inspection

Some firewalls and routers implement further restrictions on traffic, namely
that of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). This is a system where all (or sometimes
select) network packets have their headers and payload inspected to
ensure there is nothing contained which should not be allowed in/out of the
network. This raises several issues of their own. Whilst 'clear' traffic (such
as HTTP, `telnet`, FTP, etc.) is easy to inspect due to their unencrypted
nature, when it comes to SSL based traffic (including HTTPS and VPN), this
becomes impossible without either the keys that were used to initiate
connections or by terminating the traffic at the DPI firewall/router itself.

Because of this, most DPI networks operate by acting as a proxy for traffic.
That is, any node on the network makes connections as normal, but the
connections are actually made to the DPI router, which then inspects the traffic
and then opens the 'real' connection to the originally requested node on the
Internet. Because it is the terminating point for both incoming and outgoing
traffic it is able to inspect all the traffic passing it going both out and
coming in. However, to do this usually means that nodes within the network
need to install a new certificate specifically for the DPI firewall/router,
as all encrypted traffic (such as SSL) ends up as being shown to have come from
the DPI and not from the endpoint requested (as the DPI has repackaged the
traffic).

To determine whether DPI applies to a device, the following commands may be used:

```shell
$ curl https://api.balena-cloud.com/ping
curl: (60) server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none

$ openssl s_client -connect api.balena-cloud.com:443
CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=1 C = IE, ST = Dublin, L = Dublin, O = Royal College Of Surgeons In Ireland, OU = IT, CN = RCSI-TLS-PROTECT
verify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 CN = balena.io
verify return:1
...
```

Compare the output of the `openssl` command on your laptop (where the `curl`
command succeeds) with the output on the device (where the `curl` command fails).
Completely different SSL certificate chains may be printed out, indicating that
DPI is in place.

Balena devices are able to accommodate this if it is known a DPI network is in
use, by adding the `balenaRootCA` property to the `/mnt/boot/config.json` file,
where the value is the DPI's root Certificate Authority (CA) that has been
base64 encoded. This CA certificate should be supplied by the network operator
to the customer who will be operating their devices on the DPI network.

title: Core Concepts
excerpt: How {{ $names.company.lower }} gets your code to your device fleet, from end to end
---

# Core Concepts: A {{ $names.company.lower }} primer

The {{ $names.company.lower }} platform encompasses device, server, and client software, all designed to get your code securely deployed to a fleet of devices. The broad strokes are easy to grasp: once your device is set up with our [host OS][os-docs], you can push code to the {{ $names.company.lower }} [build servers][build], where it will be packaged into containers and delivered to your fleet. All your devices and their services can be managed, monitored, and updated from your [{{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard][dashboard].

If you're eager to learn more about the inner workings, you're in luck! This guide covers the components and workflows involved in a typical {{ $names.company.lower }} deployment, with enough detail to answer the most common questions. If you're ready to dig in deeper, why not [get started][getting-started] with a project of your own?

Refer to the [balena Glossary][balena-glossary] for definition on any of the terms referred in the docs.

## On your device

<img src="/img/common/architecture.webp" width="60%">

Devices in the {{ $names.company.lower }} ecosystem run [{{ $names.os.lower }}][os], a bare-bones, [Yocto Linux][yocto] based host OS, which comes packaged with [{{ $names.engine.lower }}][engine-link], our lightweight, [Docker][docker]-compatible container engine. The host OS is responsible for kicking off the device supervisor, {{ $names.company.lower }}'s agent on your device, as well as your containerized services. Within each service's container you can specify a base OS, which can come from any existing Docker base image that is compatible with your device architecture. The base OS shares a kernel with the host OS, but otherwise works independently. If you choose, your containers [can be configured][multicontainer] to run as privileged, access hardware directly, and even inject modules into the kernel. The {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor runs in its own container, which allows the device to continue running and pulling new code even if your application crashes.

### Host and kernel updates

{{ $names.company.upper }} is built with the goal of 100% updatability. While the {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor and your application containers are easy to update without losing connection to the device, the [process for updating][update-process] the host OS involves a few more steps. To mitigate problems while updating, {{ $names.company.lower }} creates an additional partition of identical size to the boot partition. The supervisor downloads a new OS version and boots the device from the alternative boot partition. This way, we can ensure that the new version of the OS is downloaded and installed correctly before rebooting the device to the new version. Even if the new version fails to boot for some reason, our system is built in such a way that the next boot will bring the device back to the original working version of the host OS, operating and ready to download a correctly installed new version.

It is important to note that all {{ $names.company.lower }} devices, both those in production and development today, have the ability to have their host OS updated. For most devices, this can even be done directly [through the dashboard][self-service].

### Device provisioning

So how are devices added to your {{ $names.company.lower }} fleets? A key feature of {{ $names.company.lower }} is that a provisioning key for your fleet is embedded in the {{ $names.os.lower }} image download. When the device boots up for the first time, it uses the provisioning API to register itself with {{ $names.company.lower }}. A new device entry on the {{ $names.company.lower }} backend is created, and a device API key for this device is generated. Once the provisioning is successful, the provisioning API key is deleted from the device. Unless someone downloads the OS from your dashboard (or via the CLI), a device cannot enter your fleet. While the details of provisioning differ depending on the device type (does it have an SD card slot? Does it boot from on-board flash?), the following things always happen at first boot:

First, the device connects to the network and performs its early provisioning, which registers it on your dashboard. Then, the container partition is decompressed, and the device supervisor starts. This is the part that takes the most time. As soon as the supervisor starts, it registers onto cloudlink and receives its unique {{ $names.company.lower }} API key. At that point, you will see the device as online in your dashboard and can use the device as normal. If the fleet that the device joins already has releases, the new device downloads the latest one and begins operating.

## Code deployment

`{{ $names.company.lower }} push` is the recommended method for deployment and [development](/learn/develop/local-mode/) on the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} platform. To use `{{ $names.company.lower }} push` you need to first [install the {{ $names.company.lower }} CLI](/reference/cli/#install-the-cli) and ensure you are logged in to your account with `{{ $names.company.lower }} login`.

![How balena push works](/img/common/deployment/balena-push.webp)

### Building containers

When you run the  `{{ $names.company.lower }} push <APP_NAME>` command from your development machine it will essentially take your project (or repository) folder, compress it and send it to the [{{ $names.cloud.lower }} build server](/learn/deploy/deployment/#the-balenacloud-build-server) where it will be built. Your code is built in an environment that matches the devices in your fleet. So if you’re pushing an app for BeagleBone Black devices, we’ll build your code in an ARMv7 environment. For Raspberry Pi 1, it's ARMv6. In fact, we provide native ARM builders for ARM images, just as we use x86 servers to build images for x86 devices.

For releases with [multiple containers][multicontainer], a `docker-compose.yml` file will need to be included at the root of your project. This configuration file specifies the services that make up your release, as well as the system resources each service has access to. Releases with a single container will have a default `docker-compose.yml` file generated if none is included.

Most services will need to include a [Dockerfile][dockerfile], which contains a list of commands for the builders. For each service, the builders will pull a base OS, install packages and dependencies, clone git repositories, and run any other steps you define for the setup and initialization of that service.

For Node.js services, you can use a package.json file without a Dockerfile. In this case, the builders create an implicit Dockerfile, which simulates the build process a Node.js/npm project expects. In this way, we are able to transparently run Node.js services on {{ $names.company.lower }}, while also taking advantage of some of Docker’s caching features. A Dockerfile will always give you more power to fine-tune, but you can start fast without and shift to a Dockerfile whenever you like.

### Getting to the devices

Once your Docker images are built, they are stored in our container registry, and the {{ $names.company.lower }} device supervisor is alerted that a new version of your application is ready. If a device is offline at the time, it will be made aware of the new containers when it comes back online. The communication between {{ $names.company.lower }} and your device is encrypted at all times, either through HTTPS or a VPN that we set up for the devices in your fleet.

The device supervisor, using [delta updates][delta-updates], then downloads the binary differences between the old and the new images, stops the old services, and starts the new ones.  You can control the exact sequence by configuring the supervisor to use [different update strategies][update-strategies]. The services themselves can also make use of [update locking][update-locking] to block updates from happening during critical times (e.g. [a drone that is flying][drone-video], or an industrial machine that is in the middle of an operation).

As the downloads proceed, you can watch the progress in the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard. You can click on any device to see more detailed information about the services being downloaded:

![Device Summary](/img/common/device/device_summary.webp)

## Device management

Once your services are up and running, you can use the dashboard to monitor and interact with them. Messages from the device supervisor, as well as anything written by your services to `stdout` and `stderr`, will appear in the *Logs* window, which can be filtered by service. Our built-in [web terminal][ssh] allows you to SSH into any running services, as well as the underlying host OS.

Much of the device, service, and fleet information provided by the dashboard is managed through the [{{ $names.company.lower }} API][api], and can also be viewed and modified using the [CLI][cli] or the [Node.js][node] and [Python][python] SDKs. {{ $names.company.upper }} has been designed so users can build rich experiences, combining device-level data provided by {{ $names.company.lower }} with higher-level fleet-specific data that lives in other data domains.

title: Going to production
excerpt: A project plan for IoT deployments with {{ $names.company.lower }}
---

# Going to production

Deploying a fleet of remote, connected devices requires some careful planning. A proper solution needs to take into account where the devices will be deployed, what the devices need to do, how the devices will be maintained, and of course, the available budget. To help you get started we've outlined a basic project plan, covering recommended steps for preparing a production fleet as well as the questions you'll want to consider along the way.

## Phase 1: Design

The first step in designing a solution is to determine how and where your devices will run. Your use case will drive the selection of the *hardware* and the *operating environment* required to successfully deploy your application.

### Hardware

There are a number of single-board computers capable of supporting Linux and running applications on the edge. The options vary widely in terms of capability and price, so it's important to pay close attention to the features that will meet your application's needs. Regardless of the hardware platform you choose, you'll want to consider the following:

* CPU: Do you have software components that require the x86 architecture? ARM chips are often cheaper and consume less power, but x86 can often provide more processing capability.
* RAM: You should ensure that you have a comfortable buffer of memory. Software must be able to evolve with changing business needs and you may find yourself deploying new features beyond what you originally scoped. Having plenty of available memory will save you time and effort (and possibly an expensive upgrade cycle) later.
* Peripherals: Are there special hardware devices that will need custom drivers?
* Storage: SD cards are common in embedded devices, but are slower and *much* less reliable than onboard flash storage. Especially if your application will be performing many read/write cycles, avoiding SD storage will reduce the risk of data corruption. If using SD cards, we recommend SanDisk Extreme Pro SD cards.
* Power: Not all power supplies are fully compatible with all boards (especially USB-based supplies). It is important to confirm that the power supply is capable of actually providing the required power before widespread deployment. If using any peripherals, the power requirements will be higher than the board's rating.

Of course, the single biggest choice you have to make is whether to use off-the-shelf hardware or a custom device. An off-the-shelf device has many advantages, including lower price, faster availability, and broader industry support. But it's possible that no existing device fully meets your needs. In this case it's crucial to think about your operating environment—you need to be sure that it will work with your hardware and that it can be kept up to date with the latest security patches.


### Operating environment

One of the challenges in building applications for distributed fleets is aligning your development environment with the operating environment running on your devices. You'll need a way to make sure your application and its dependencies work with your device's architecture, as well as a plan for pushing updates to your fleet without losing access to your devices.

{{ $names.company.upper }} solves for these concerns by running {{ $names.os.lower }}, a bare-bones host OS with a lightweight, Docker-compatible container engine, [{{ $names.engine.lower }}][engine-link]. With containers, you can develop your application in the way you are most comfortable, and then run that environment on your device without worrying about the underlying hardware support. Any dependencies, such as libraries and runtime environments, will already be packaged in the container.

Containers also make remote updates a straightforward process. A new release can be downloaded, verified, and started while the host OS maintains a network connection and handles any issues.

One thing to consider is whether you'll want to use one container or many. Each approach has its advantages. A single container is the simplest to manage—there's no inter-container communication or resource contention to worry about. But it does mean that you will need to manage all the components of your application in one place.

Using multiple containers allows you to separate components and even development teams. Splitting your application into containerized services could, for example, allow one team to work on the frontend of your application while another is working on the backend, with each team sending updates independently. The different teams could even use completely different operating environments: one team could use Debian and another Fedora. This does require some coordination, as you will need to assign the resources needed by each container via something like a [Docker Compose][docker-compose] file.


## Phase 2: Prototype

During the prototyping phase, it's important to develop on the same device you'll be using in your production fleet. It may be tempting to use a virtual device, but there are a number of drawbacks to this approach. Virtual devices tend to be more difficult to work with than physical devices and are often much slower. By sticking with the same device through prototype, pilot, and production phases, you'll reduce the risk of any unexpected failures along the way.

You'll want to make sure you have easy access to your device, especially in the case that something goes wrong. It's best to prototype in a local lab under your control. At this stage of development, your application is incomplete and not fully tested, so you want a safe environment where you can quickly develop without risk of exposing data externally.

The prototyping phase is where some of the developer-focused features of {{ $names.company.lower }} start to come into play, offering a number of ways to access the host OS and containers running on your device:

### Development images

When developing a new application, you should consider using a [development image][dev-vs-prod] of {{ $names.os.lower }}. These images have a number of features that, for security reasons, are not present in the production releases of {{ $names.os.lower }}. These include:

* Passwordless SSH access to the host OS
* Access to the Docker socket
* Serial and console logging and interactive login
* Local mode functionality

### Local mode

{{ $names.os.upper }} [local mode][local-mode] gives you the ability to build and deploy to a device on the local network without involving the {{ $names.company.lower }} cloud builder. This allows you to very quickly iterate and test functionality—in many cases, such as configuration changes or changes made to code in an interpreted language, updates can be deployed without requiring a build at all. A local deployment lets you directly mirror your development environment on a test device.

### Connectivity

While prototyping, you should start thinking about how your devices will be connected when deployed in the real world.  If it's possible to have network settings preconfigured, or to have everything done by DHCP, this is easy. But most devices will need onsite configuration.

{{ $names.company.upper }} provides the ability to configure networking from inside containers and exposes a great deal of functionality to make this easier. One example is the [wifi-connect][wifi-connect] project, which allows the device to create its own WiFi access point that users can connect with to configure proper credentials. The {{ $names.company.lower }} [supervisor API][supervisor-api] also makes it possible to configure more advanced networking parameters, including hostname and proxy configuration.

### Multiple developers

During the prototyping phase, you may want to allow multiple developers to share resources. With {{ $names.company.lower }}, you can add multiple developers as [collaborators][collaborators] to a fleet, giving them the ability to manage the fleet's devices and push code updates.

## Phase 3: Pilot

After your application development is mostly complete, it's important to do some more real world testing. {{ $names.company.upper }} exposes functionality to make this easy as well, providing tools that help you move from the prototype phase toward a full production environment:

### Production images

At this point it makes sense to move from development {{ $names.os.lower }} images to full production images, ensuring that your application still runs properly without full local console access. You can still [access][ssh] the host OS and containers via the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard and CLI, but the production {{ $names.os.lower }} image will close all open inbound ports.

For Production and Enterprise plan users who require a stable, supported release, you should choose an [ESR version][esr] of the host OS. An ESR version guarantees that you will only have to update the host OS on the devices at most twice a year to ensure you are on a supported version. You can view devices that have ESR versions of the host OS [here][esr-devices].

### Test outside the lab

Testing outside the lab helps you see how your device behaves in networks that are not fully under your control. Ideally, this should be done in an environment that mimics where your devices will be when they are in production, but is still at least somewhat accessible. For example, if you are building a consumer device, you could have your employees and their families test in their homes. You might also look for customers who are willing to be alpha testers, who might provide feedback about your application while understanding that it's not quite done yet.

### Log collection

It's crucial that you are able to get logs and telemetry from your devices once they're out of the lab. You can use the console logging functionality exposed in the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard to read your application logs. 

If your application generates enough log data that you need an analytics platform to make sense of it all, consider [adding a log collection agent][custom-logging] to your containers, just as you would in any other environment.

### Update testing

Make sure to test all the update functionality you can before your devices are out in the wild and inaccessible. For both release and host OS updates, {{ $names.company.lower }} includes a number of features to make sure the update process doesn't affect your ability to connect to your devices and restore functionality, but you'll still want to understand the factors that can affect the update process.

Specifically, think about testing:

* loss of power during an update
* loss of network during an update
* pushing a new update while another is in progress

Understanding how your devices handle adverse conditions allows you to be confident in your fleet's ability to receive timely updates.

## Phase 4: Production

Now that your testing is wrapping up, it's time to get your devices into a fleet out into the world! At this point you'll be moving from a primarily development-focused perspective to a primarily operations-focused perspective, at least for the current release of your application. Of course, you may want to continue development on the next version, knowing that you can safely roll out updates to your fleet at any point with {{ $names.company.lower }}!

### Preloading images and preregistering devices

While a device will provision itself and download your latest release as soon as it's turned on and connected to the Internet, this might not be the experience you want your users to have. It would be nice to have something that works right away, rather than having to wait for a potentially slow download to finish.

Happily, you can [preload][preload] your release into a {{ $names.os.lower }} image with a one-time process. Then, when that image is flashed onto your devices in the factory, it will have the release already installed and ready. Any updates made to the fleet after the preloading process will be downloaded and applied when the device is brought online, so there's no need to worry about devices that have been sitting in a warehouse or on store shelves.

For situations where you need to register your devices before they have been powered on or connected to the network, you can [preregister][preregister] them. Preregistering a device allows the creation of individually registered devices in a fleet, which is extremely useful in situations such as manufacturing where a device may require tracking, as a specific device UUID can then be associated with a specific customer order.

More information about preloading images and preregistering devices can be found in the [CLI Advanced Masterclass][cli-advanced-masterclass] or the [CLI documentation][cli].

### Canary deployments

When updating software on production devices, it makes sense to be cautious and start with a few devices to make sure nothing goes wrong. A common practice is to start with a few "canary" devices and then slowly roll the update out to larger and larger numbers of devices.

The {{ $names.company.lower }} API includes functionality that allows for [fine-grained control of updates][staged-releases]. With these endpoints, you can turn off automatic release updates, set a target release for the whole fleet, or set target releases for a specific subset of devices. The [device tag][tags] and [filter][filters] functionality makes it easy to assign groups of devices to certain phases of your deployment.

title: Security
excerpt: The {{ $names.company.lower }} approach to securing your fleet
---

# Security

{{ $names.company.upper }} takes your fleet’s security very seriously.  We understand that your data and devices are valuable and often critical, and we take precautions to ensure that your devices and data are not compromised.

## Trust and Transparency
At {{ $names.company.lower }}, our approach to security is guided by ISO 27001:2022, ensuring a structured, reliable system that aligns with our values. Our ISMS (Information Security Management System) has undergone multiple audits by accredited third parties to verify our compliance and effectiveness. 

Rather than using rigid templates, we customized our implementation to fit our team's way of working, maintaining transparency without compromising our culture. This system is continually monitored and improved, demonstrating our commitment to providing a secure and dependable platform while staying true to who we are.

For transparency we maintain a trust center at [trust.balena.io](https://trust.balena.io), where we surface our monitored information security controls, sub processors and security acknowledgements.

## Secure Ecosystem

Security begins with the ability to send timely updates to your devices. By providing a mechanism for regular, reliable, and verifiable updates, {{ $names.company.lower }} gives you the tools you need to keep your device fleet up to date and protected against attacks.

To keep the {{ $names.company.lower }} ecosystem secure, we focus on the principle of least privilege—permissions are given only as necessary, and no information is available to any account or device unless it is required for the tasks being performed. We take a number of steps to isolate all components in the update process, so that unauthorized access to any one component will not provide enough information to access additional components, accounts, or devices.

The core mechanism for implementing this security approach is through API access control. By controlling access to the API, the actions that are permitted, and the available communication channels, we can protect fleets at all points of entry.

In this document, we will further explain how the {{ $names.company.lower }} infrastructure implements access control across the entire lifecycle, from device access and runtime management, to the image build process, and finally to the API and backend services.

## Access to {{ $names.company.lower }}

The first points of access to the {{ $names.company.lower }} ecosystem are the user dashboard and the CLI. From these, a user can add and remove SSH keys, retrieve an API token, and manage devices. Multiple methods of authentication are supported for logging in:

- Simple username/password authentication is supported, though not recommended for production accounts.
- {{ $names.company.upper }} supports a number of [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) providers, including GitHub and Google.
- Two-factor authentication using the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) is fully supported.  This enables integration with tools such as Google Authenticator.

## Device access

Device access is managed by our host operating system, [{{ $names.os.lower }}](/reference/OS/overview/2.x). {{ $names.os.upper }} is a thin Linux that supports the {{ $names.company.lower }} services and user containers. {{ $names.os.upper }} is built using [Yocto Linux](https://www.yoctoproject.org/), the de facto standard for building lightweight embedded Linux environments. Using Yocto allows {{ $names.company.lower }} to build images that contain no unused or unnecessary code in either userspace or the running kernel, minimizing the device's available attack surface. All {{ $names.company.lower }} software running on devices is 100% open source and can be independently audited and verified. Device access is granted to a subset of {{ $names.company.lower }} employees to enable support and device troubleshooting. This access is controlled by ssh key access and only after access is explicitly granted to balena.

User source code and images are stored on {{ $names.company.lower }} backend servers with access limited only to administrative/operational staff and are not exposed to anyone outside of {{ $names.company.lower }}. It is also possible to bypass the {{ $names.company.lower }} builder entirely and push only pre-built artifacts, meaning that {{ $names.company.lower }} never has access to the code at any point.

When a {{ $names.os.lower }} image is downloaded and flashed to a device, it comes with a provisioning key that allows devices to join a specific fleet. When the device boots up for the first time, it uses the provisioning API to register itself with {{ $names.company.lower }}. A new device entry on the {{ $names.company.lower }} backend is created, and a device API key for this device is generated. Once the provisioning is successful, the provisioning API key is deleted from the device. The device API key allows control of the following:

- changing the device metadata
- reading metadata of the fleet associated with the device
- reading variables associated with the device
- reading variables for the fleet that is associated with the device
- reading build logs of the fleet associated with the device

If a device is compromised, the device API key can only be used to read information about the device or the fleet the device is associated with. A fleet owner can remove and revoke the API key of a compromised device by simply deleting the device from the dashboard.

A device API key also allows a device to request the latest release. When a device requests an update, this API key is sent to {{ $names.company.lower }} and authenticated. Once the API key has been authenticated, a Docker pull is initiated on the device.

Both the Docker pull request and the actual image download process are performed using HTTPS, so are TLS encrypted. HTTPS connections are always outbound from the device to the {{ $names.company.lower }} service, meaning that no inbound connections are created and no inbound ports on the firewall are required.
## Runtime management

### Cloudlink

Cloudlink status in the dashboard represents a device connection to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} backend. This connection is the underlying technology that enables the following functionalities within {{ $names.cloud.lower }}, and as such we indicate the status of Cloudlink to help you to understand the status of your device and what functionality may or may not be available.

- [SSH access](/learn/manage/ssh-access/) via CLI or web terminal
- [Public Device Url](/learn/manage/actions/#public-device-url)
- [Device actions](/learn/manage/actions/#device-actions) that allow controlling device state
- [Host OS Updates](/reference/OS/updates/self-service/)
- [Device Diagnostics](/reference/diagnostics/)

Currently, Cloudlink uses [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) as an underlying technology to achieve its functionality. Devices only connect outbound to Cloudlink, and all traffic over Cloudlink is encrypted with TLS.

Cloudlink disallows device-to-device traffic and prohibits outbound traffic to the Internet.  If a device were compromised, this ensures that it cannot contaminate another device. To achieve this the Cloudlink service is configured to run with iptables default `FORWARD` policy set to `DROP` and we do not enable OpenVPN [--client-to-client](https://www.mankier.com/8/openvpn#--client-to-client) config option server side, so there is no way for the traffic between clients to traverse the interface(s).

Currently, authentication against Cloudlink is performed with API token authentication.  API keys can be managed and revoked in the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard.

Cloudlink connection is optional and [can be disabled](/reference/supervisor/bandwidth-reduction/) to conserve bandwidth or to remove the option of outside device control through the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard or API.  When disabled, the Cloudlink connection will not be established from the device. No traffic will be transmitted or received through this channel.  If desired, Cloudlink can be enabled and disabled programmatically so that it is turned on only when in active use (e.g. for interactive debugging) and disabled normally.

It is important to understand that due to its current design, Cloudlink is not architected for high availability. Cloudlink will periodically drop connections momentarily due to re-configuration or scaling, but it reconnects with the device automatically. For mission-critical workflows, we recommend designing your solution to be resilient to the potential brief unavailability of these specific interactive features. Furthermore, to protect overall platform stability for all users, devices that send/receive large amounts of data via Cloudlink continuously may be throttled. 

### Support access

Device access is granted to a subset of {{ $names.company.lower }} employees to enable support and device troubleshooting.  This access is controlled by the same SSH access mechanisms described above, and only SSH key access is permitted. {{ $names.company.upper }} employees access devices only for user support and to maintain device state and uptime with permission from the customer.

If desired, this functionality can be disabled by removing the {{ $names.company.lower }} SSH public key from the device (or from the base image before flashing it onto the device).  However, this will render the device inaccessible remotely for the purposes of support or repairs and updates to the base OS.  Thus this should be done with extreme caution and only after careful consideration of the tradeoffs.

### Ports used

All communication between devices and the {{ $names.company.lower }} service are outbound from the device.  Ports that are used by devices are:


Port | Protocol | Status | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
53 | UDP | Required | DNS: used by devices to resolve {{ $names.company.lower }} hostnames for connection to the {{ $names.company.lower }} service
123 | UDP | Required | NTP: used by devices to synchronize time
443 | TCP | Required | HTTPS: used by devices to poll {{ $names.company.lower }} for updates and to download releases and host OS updates.<br><br>Cloudlink: used by devices to connect to {{ $names.company.lower }} to provide real-status, control, and an interactive terminal (optional service)

### Device metadata

Devices contain metadata that identifies the device, fleet, and state of deployed software.  This metadata is used to track the state of the device within the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard and to associate the device with a specific fleet.

Currently, metadata such as device identifiers or WiFi credentials are not encrypted on disk by default.  This is because most commercially available devices do not support any form of hardware-level encryption, meaning that the decryption keys for this data would have to be stored in an accessible area of the device.  Storing the keys with the encrypted data means that it is trivial for anyone with physical access to the device to decrypt the data at any point, rendering the encryption itself moot. If you do have a device that is capable of hardware-level encryption, please contact us to discuss your options.

## Building images

The first step in deploying to a fleet of devices is to build a Docker image that contains everything necessary to run your application. While these images can be built locally, {{ $names.company.lower }} provides a powerful image builder that is more appropriate for most use cases. The builder for x86 images is hosted on AWS, while the builder for ARM images is hosted by a combination of AWS and Hetzner.

User code and data is pushed to the builders via git using SSH with public key encryption, ensuring that it is encrypted when sent to the {{ $names.company.lower }} builders. SSH keys are managed via the user dashboard or CLI tools.

Once user container images are built, they are pushed to the {{ $names.company.lower }} Docker registry. Only the {{ $names.company.lower }} builder has permission to write to the Docker registry, preventing tampering with the images from external sources.

## The API and backend

The {{ $names.company.lower }} API provides a central mechanism for authentication, requesting information, and making changes to the database. The API manages communication both internally among the backend services and externally for users and devices.

The API interface is based on the Open Data (OData) format. All requests are authenticated with an API token, which users access on the dashboard and can refresh via the API.

When possible, all backend services and components are run with user-level permissions.  Where permission escalation is required, it is performed temporarily and de-escalated as soon as the escalated process is complete.  This reduces the risk of a particular backend component being leveraged to compromise other components or other users' data and processes.

All software and images built within {{ $names.company.lower }} track the upstream projects directly and are rebuilt regularly to integrate the latest functionality and security updates.  Internal services are run on Debian Linux and regularly rebuilt/updated.

HTTPS is mandatory for all services internally, meaning no data is transmitted unencrypted between {{ $names.company.lower }} servers.

The {{ $names.company.lower }} backend services, with the exception of the ARM image builders, are hosted on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).  Using a VPC isolates {{ $names.company.lower }} from any other services hosted in AWS, allowing an additional layer of security and separation.

## Conclusion

The safety and security of your data and devices is crucial to us at {{ $names.company.lower }}.  We do everything in our power to keep our services secure and transparent. If you have any questions about our security or want to engage in our [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) process, please contact us at [security@{{ $names.email_domain }}](mailto:security@{{ $names.email_domain }}) and we will answer in detail.

title: Advanced boot settings
excerpts: Configuration options to expose more device functionality to {{ $names.os.lower }}
---

# Advanced boot settings

__Warning:__ This page contains details of advanced configuration options that expose more functionality, but any mistakes may potentially leave a device inaccessible. Be sure to try your changes in a controlled environment before applying them to production devices.

## Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi exposes device configuration options via a text file on the [boot partition][boot-partition] named [`config.txt`][config-txt]. You can change boot options in this file, either by manually editing it before the device's first boot or editing the default [configuration][configuration-list] values using the device [Configuration][configuration] tab in the balenaCloud dashboard. 

The boot partition is mounted on the device at `/mnt/boot`, so the file is located at `/mnt/boot/config.txt` on the device. To view the contents of `config.txt` on a provisioned device, use the following commands:

```shell
$ balena ssh <uuid>
$ cat /mnt/boot/config.txt
```

### Modifying `config.txt` locally before the first boot

Before the device is [provisioned][device-provisioning], you may edit `config.txt` by mounting a flashed SD card (with the partition label `resin-boot`) and editing the file directly. Any values added to `config.txt` will be added to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API during device provisioning and displayed on the dashboard. This will only work if you edit the file before the device's first boot, as after device provisioning, any changes will be overwritten by the device supervisor with values read from the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API.

### Modifying `config.txt` using configuration variables

After the device has been [provisioned][device-provisioning], you can modify the values in `config.txt` using the [configuration][configuration] tab on the dashboard. In order to modify a `config.txt` variable, the device supervisor will apply the changes and reboot the device.

Variables that start with the `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_` or `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_` prefix will be added to the `config.txt` file, replacing any preexisting values in the file. For example, a variable named `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_start_x` with the value of `1` will result in the following entry in `config.txt`:

```
start_x=1
```

To manage the configuration via the dashboard, modify the variables via the *Configuration* tab on the [fleet][configuration-fleet] or [device][configuration-device] level. The variables with the same named defined at the device level, will override the variables defined fleet wide. See [Custom Configuration][custom-configuration] in order to modify configuration options remotely using the balenaCloud dashboard.

### GPU Memory

The [amount of memory][gpu-memory] that is addressable from the GPU may be configured by adding entries to `config.txt`. You can also set specific values of `gpu_mem` for Raspberry Pis with 256, 512, or 1024 MB (or greater) of RAM. Values will be ignored for those devices whose memory size does not match. For the Raspberry Pi 4, which has versions with RAM greater than 1GB, the minimum and maximum values are the same as for a 1GB device.

```
gpu_mem=16
gpu_mem_256=64
gpu_mem_512=128
gpu_mem_1024=256
```

`gpu_mem` is the default amount of memory, which, by default, is set to 16MB (specified by `gpu_mem=16`). This may well be less than you require depending on your application (particularly applications that make heavy use of the Raspberry Pi's graphics capabilities). As per the [Raspberry Pi documentation][gpu-memory], values of `gpu_mem` over 512 are not recommended, will provide no performance improvements, and are untested.

### Enable serial interface

The BCM2837 on the Raspberry Pi 3 has 2 built-in [UARTs][uart] (as did its predecessors), however, to support the Bluetooth functionality the fully-featured PL011 UART was moved from the header pins to the Bluetooth chip and the mini UART made available on header pins 8 & 10.

This has a number of consequences for users of the serial interface:

- The /dev/ttyAMA0 previously used to access the UART now connects to Bluetooth.
- The mini UART is now available on /dev/ttyS0. This is disabled by default for [production images][image-variants] and enabled by default for [development images][image-variants].
- The mini UART is a secondary low throughput UART intended to be used as a console. it supports the following functionality:
  - 7 or 8 bit operation.
  - 1 start and 1 stop bit.
  - No parities.
  - Break generation.
  - 8 symbols deep FIFOs for receive and transmit.
  - SW controlled RTS, SW readable CTS.
  - Auto flow control with programmable FIFO level.
  - 16550 like registers.
  - Baudrate derived from system clock.

The mini UART is enabled by default for development images. For production images either enable it using the [Configuration][configuration] tab or before device provisioning by adding the following entry to `config.txt`:

```
enable_uart=1
```

__Note:__ For further information on UART device tree overlays, see the [Raspberry Pi documentation][uart].

### Setting device tree overlays (`dtoverlay`) and parameters (`dtparam`)

The Raspberry Pi allows loading [custom device tree overlays][device-tree-overlay] using the `dtoverlay` setting in `config.txt`. It also allows setting parameters for the default overlay with the `dtparam` setting. For these settings, the syntax is different from other keys because several entries can be added, and the bootloader will use all of them.

To allow setting several values, devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} version >= 2.12.0  (supervisor >= 7.0.0), will parse the values of `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay` and `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtparam` in a special way where the value of the configuration variable will be treated as the contents of a JSON array (without the enclosing braces `[]`), so a comma-separated list of quote-enclosed values (straight quotes, not curly) will be split into several lines.

For example, the default value of `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtparam = "i2c_arm=on","spi=on","audio=on"` will translate into the following entries in config.txt:

```
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtparam=spi=on
dtparam=audio=on
```

Please note that `spi`, `audio`, and all of the `i2c` params should be specified within their own sets of quotes in order to be written correctly to `config.txt`.

Another example would be setting several overlays with their own parameters, e.g. `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay = "i2c-rtc,ds1307","lirc-rpi"` will translate to:

```
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307
dtoverlay=lirc-rpi
```

As of Supervisor v16+, the above will translate to:

```
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc
dtparam=dc1307
dtoverlay=lirc-rpi
```

This modifies each parameter to be on its own line in order to avoid the 80 character line limit imposed by config.txt. It is the recommended method of setting one or more overlays with their own parameters.

This parsing will only be done if the value is a valid string, so if it doesn't begin with a quote `"`, the value will be parsed as a single string and not split into several lines. For instance `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay = i2c-rtc,ds1307` will translate to:

```
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307
```

### Disabling the rainbow splash screen

To disable the Raspberry Pi rainbow splash screen, add the `disable_splash=1` entry to `config.txt`.

__Note:__ This setting disables the Raspberry Pi rainbow splash screen but does not disable the {{ $names.company.lower }} logo splash screen. If you would like to replace the {{ $names.company.lower }} logo with your custom splash logo, you must do so via the [Configuration page][configuration-page].

title: Configuration
excerpt: Instructions for editing and customizing config.json for modifying the behavior of {{ $names.os.lower }}
---

# Configuring balenaOS

## About config.json

A balenaOS image, by default, does not include any configuration information
to associate it with a fleet. When a customer downloads a provisioning
image from the Dashboard, balenaCloud injects the configuration for the specific
fleet the image is being downloaded for. Similarly, the balena CLI allows
the download of a balenaOS image for a device type (and specific version), but
requires that this image has a configuration added (usually via the use of
`balena os configure`) before flashing to bootable media.

**Note:** The `config.json` file is different from the [`config.txt`](/reference/OS/advanced/#configtxt) file, also located in the boot partition, which is used by the Raspberry Pi to set device configuration options.

The behavior of {{ $names.os.lower }} can be configured by editing the 
`config.json` file. This file is located in the boot partition accepts a 
[range of fields](#valid-fields) to modify the behavior of the host OS. 
The boot partition will be the one that shows up, usually named `resin-boot`.
 On-device, the boot partition is mounted at `/mnt/boot/`. Assuming you're 
still logged into your debug device, run the following:

```shell

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  512 Jul  8 19:55 system-connections
```

As you can see, all the boot required files exist in the root, including
`config.json`, and it is from the `/mnt/boot` mountpoint that any services that
require access to files on the boot partition (including the configuration)
read this data.

**Important note:** There is an occasional misunderstanding that the directory
`/resin-boot` when on-device is the correct directory to modify files in.
This is _not_ the case, and in fact this directory is a pre-built directory
that exists as part of the root FS partition, and _not_ the mounted boot
partition. Let's verify this:

```shell
root@f220105:~# cat /resin-boot/config.json
{
  "deviceType": "raspberrypi4-64",
  "persistentLogging": false
}
```

As you can see, there's very little information in the configuration file in
the `/resin-boot` directory, and certainly nothing that associates it with a
fleet. On the other hand, if we look at `/mnt/boot/config.json` you can
see that all the required information for the device to be associated with its
fleet exists:

```shell
root@f220105:~# cat /mnt/boot/config.json | jq
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://api.balena-cloud.com",
  "appUpdatePollInterval": 900000,
  "applicationId": "1958513",
  "deltaEndpoint": "https://delta.balena-cloud.com",
  "developmentMode": "true",
  "deviceApiKey": "KEY",
  "deviceApiKeys": {
    "api.balena-cloud.com": "KEY"
  },
  "deviceType": "raspberrypi4-64",
  "listenPort": "48484",
  "mixpanelToken": "9ef939ea64cb6cd8bbc96af72345d70d",
  "registryEndpoint": "registry2.balena-cloud.com",
  "userId": "234385",
  "vpnEndpoint": "cloudlink.balena-cloud.com",
  "vpnPort": "443",
  "uuid": "f220105b5a8aa79b6359d2df76a73954",
  "registered_at": 1660904681747,
  "deviceId": 7842821
}
```

Key naming in `config.json` still adheres to the "legacy" convention of
balenaCloud applications instead of fleets. For details, refer to the [blog post](https://www.balena.io/blog/the-road-to-multi-app-transitioning-balenacloud-applications-to-fleets/).

There's a fairly easy way to remember which is the right place, the root FS
is read-only, so if you try and modify the `config.json` you'll be told it's
read-only.

## Configuring config.json

Before the device is [provisioned](/learn/welcome/primer/#device-provisioning), you may edit `config.json` by mounting a flashed SD card (with the partition label `resin-boot`) and editing the file directly. The [boot partition](/reference/OS/overview/2.x/#stateless-and-read-only-rootfs) is mounted on the device at `/mnt/boot`, and so on the device, the file is located at `/mnt/boot/config.json`. For example, to output a formatted version of `config.json` on a device, use the following commands:

```shell
{{ $names.company.lower }} ssh <uuid>
cat /mnt/boot/config.json | jq '.'
```

**Warning:** Editing config.json on a provisioned device should be done very carefully as any mistakes in the syntax of this file can leave a device inaccessible. If you do make a mistake, ensure that you do not
exit the device's SSH connection until the configuration _is_ correct.

After provisioning, editing `config.json` as described above is not reliable or advisable because the [supervisor](/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/) may overwrite certain fields, such as `persistentLogging`, with values read from the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API. To safely modify the values of `config.json` on a provisioned device use one of the following methods:

- Update the device [hostname](#hostname) via the [supervisor API](/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/#patch-v1devicehost-config).
- Modify the [persistent logging](#persistentlogging) configuration via device [configuration](/learn/manage/configuration/) tab in the balenaCloud dashboard.
- Apply `config.json` updates remotely via the {{ $names.cli.lower }} using the [configizer project]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/configizer).

Alternatively, you can always reprovision a device with an updated `config.json` file.

As an example, we're going to change the hostname from the short UUID of the
device to something else. We will start by taking a backup of the config.json and printing out the file using the `jq` command. Here, we have changed the value of `hostname` field to `debug-device`

```shell
root@f220105:~# cd /mnt/boot/
root@f220105:/mnt/boot# cp config.json config.json.backup && cat config.json.backup | jq ".hostname=\"debug-device\"" -c > config.json
root@f220105:/mnt/boot# cat config.json | jq
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://api.balena-cloud.com",
  "appUpdatePollInterval": 900000,
  "applicationId": "1958513",
  "applicationName": "nuctest",
  "deltaEndpoint": "https://delta.balena-cloud.com",
  "developmentMode": "true",
  "deviceApiKey": "006e82c27eabcd579ce310687b937cd5",
  "deviceApiKeys": {
    "api.balena-cloud.com": "006e82c27eabcd579ce310687b937cd5"
  },
  "deviceType": "raspberrypi4-64",
  "listenPort": "48484",
  "mixpanelToken": "9ef939ea64cb6cd8bbc96af72345d70d",
  "persistentLogging": false,
  "pubnubPublishKey": "",
  "pubnubSubscribeKey": "",
  "registryEndpoint": "registry2.balena-cloud.com",
  "userId": 234385,
  "vpnEndpoint": "cloudlink.balena-cloud.com",
  "vpnPort": "443",
  "uuid": "f220105b5a8aa79b6359d2df76a73954",
  "registered_at": 1660904681747,
  "deviceId": 7842821,
  "hostname": "debug-device"
}
root@f220105:/mnt/boot# reboot
```

The reboot is required as the hostname change will not be picked up until the
device restarts. Wait a little while, and then SSH back into the device, we'll
see that the hostname has changed:

```shell
root@debug-device:~#
```

Whilst making the changes, the new configuration is written to the `config.json`
file, whilst we have a backup of the original (`config.json.backup`). Remember, 
should you need to change anything, _always_ keep a copy of the original configuration
so you can restore it before you exit the device. Check out the 
[valid fields](#sample-configjson) available to be configured on a balena device.

title: Extended Support Release Process
excerpt: An overview of the {{ $names.company.lower }} extended support release process
extras: esr-devices-js

# Extended Support Release (ESR) process

__Note:__ This feature is only available on [Production and Enterprise plans][billing].

The {{ $names.os.lower }} Extended Support Release (ESR) process allows fleet owners to update to a new ESR version on their devices at most twice a year to ensure they are on a supported version. New ESR versions are released on a three-month schedule, and as such, fleet owners know in advance when releases will be available and when they need to upgrade.

Each ESR release is supported for nine months from the time of release. A supported ESR version implies that high-risk security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes will be backported to that version, and are guaranteed not to break the interface. Backports of any functional enhancements are not in scope.

## ESR schedule

Three lines of ESR versions are supported, known as _next_, _current_, and _sunset_. Every three months, a new ESR version is released, and each line will transition forward at that time as illustrated on the following diagram:

![ESR schedule](/img/common/esr-process.webp)

ESR versions are named by year and month `yyyy.m` and contain a patch version number starting at 0. So, `2022.1.4` would be the fifth release of the `2022.1` ESR version. Since ESR versions will only receive backports for high-risk security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes, new releases during the lifecycle of an ESR version will only increment the patch number.

For example, an ESR version is released known as `2022.10`, which becomes the _next-ESR_. In three months, a new ESR version, i.e., `2023.1`, becomes the _next-ESR_ line, while `2022.10` transitions to become the _current-ESR_. Similarly, three months after that, there is a new ESR version, and `2022.10` becomes the _sunset-ESR_. Three months later and nine months after release, the `2022.10` ESR version will reach its end-of-life, and no further updates will be offered, and users should update to one of the supported releases to receive future updates by performing a [self-service update][self-service-updates].

## Using an ESR host OS version

### Adding a new device

For new devices, if you are on a Production or Enterprise plan with a [supported device type](#supported-devices), when you add a new device, you will be given the option to _Select OS type_ which defaults to _{{$names.os.lower}} ESR_. If you would like a non-ESR version, expand this dropdown and select _{{$names.os.lower}}_ for the host OS type.

<img src="/img/common/esr-new-device.webp" alt="Add new ESR device" width="80%">

Next, select the ESR version as either _next_, _current_, or _sunset_ if available. The _next_ version is selected by default and offers at least six months (and up to nine months) of critical backports and fixes.

### Host OS update

For those users on a Production or Enterprise plan with an existing [supported device](#supported-devices), you can update to an ESR version via a [self-serve update][self-service-updates]. You should select the _{{$names.os.lower}} ESR_ host OS type and your chosen ESR version.

__Note:__ Once updated to an ESR version, it is not possible to update from an ESR host OS version to a non-ESR one.

## Supported devices

All device types are eligible for ESR, however they require a dedicated build and release pipeline so support needs to be requested via our [support channels]({{ $links.mainSiteUrl }}/support).

ESR host OS versions are currently available for the following devices:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Device Name</th>
      <th>Machine Name</th>
      <th>Architecture</th>

## Introduction

With {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.0, connectivity management changed from **[ConnMan][connman-link]** to **[NetworkManager][networkmanager-link]**. **NetworkManager** allows {{ $names.os.lower }} more flexibility when configuring the network setup, and, in conjunction with **[ModemManager][modemmanager-link]**, allows {{ $names.os.lower }} to offer first class [GSM/Cellular support](#cellular-modem-setup).

All of the network configuration for {{ $names.os.lower }} can be done through files in the boot partition of your device. If you have a freshly downloaded {{ $names.os.lower }} `.img`, you can mount it and inspect the `resin-boot` or `resin-flash` (for devices that boot from eMMC) partition. In the boot partition you will find a directory called `system-connections`.

__Note:__ When editing files for connectivity in the boot partition, make sure you're in the `/mnt/boot/system-connections` folder so that they persist after reboot.

The `system-connections` directory consists of a set of connection files—one file per connection. The file `balena-sample.ignore` is a template or example file which you can copy to create new connections. If you added a WiFi connection from the dashboard when you downloaded your image, you should see its configuration file already created for you under the name `resin-wifi`. You will notice that there is no file for ethernet, this is because **NetworkManager** will always set up a default ethernet connection. If you want a specific configuration for the ethernet connection you will need to create a new connection file for it. Most of the allowed options for these connection files can be found in the [**NetworkManager** settings reference][nm-setting-ref]

## WiFi Setup

If you entered your WiFi SSID and passphrase when you downloaded {{ $names.os.lower }} from the dashboard, you should have a file called `resin-wifi` in the folder `/system-connections/` (as mentioned above, this is found in the boot partition of your image).

```
[connection]
id={{ $names.company.short }}-wifi
type=wifi

[wifi]
hidden=true
mode=infrastructure
ssid=My Awesome WiFi Ssid

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
method=auto

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=super_secret_wifi_password
```

This file sets up a simple WiFi connection to a network named `My Awesome WiFi Ssid` with a WiFi password (`psk`) of `super_secret_wifi_password`. If you want to add multiple different WiFi credentials, then simply make a copy of `resin-wifi` or `balena-sample.ignore` and change the `SSID` and `psk` key values. You can also add the `autoconnect-priority` integer values in each file to define the priority of each connection when the device has multiple WiFi connections it can connect to.

To set WiFi as the default route to the internet, you need to force `eth0` to have a low route metric and set the `never-default` option. The following ethernet configuration file can be put in the `/system-connections/` folder to accomplish this:

```
[connection]
id=my-ethernet
type=ethernet
interface-name=eth0
permissions=
secondaries=

[ethernet]
mac-address-blacklist=

[ipv4]
never-default=true
route-metric=2000
dns-search=

ignore-auto-routes=true
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
dns-search=
method=auto
```
__Note:__ Depending on the device, the interface name may not be `eth0`. To check the correct name, you can run `ifconfig` from the web terminal found on the device dashboard.

The connection file also defines what kind of security the network expects. If you want to set up a network with more elaborate security requirements, checkout the [**NetworkManager** settings reference page][nm-setting-ref]. If you want to connect to an unsecured WiFi network, simply remove the `[wifi-security]` section.

As an example the below config sets up a WPA2-enterprise WiFi connection:
```
[connection]
id={{ $names.company.short }}-wifi
type=wifi

[wifi]
ssid=PLACE_SSID_HERE
mode=infrastructure
security=802-11-wireless-security

[wifi-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-eap

[802-1x]
eap=peap
identity=PLACE_YOUR_ID_HERE
phase2-auth=mschapv2
password=PLACE_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
method=auto
```

An example for [Eduroam][eduroam-ref] (network for students and universities) is shown in the config below. You'll need to change the listed fields for your educational institution. Contact your educational institution's IT department for the connection specifics.

```
[connection]
id=eduroam
type=wifi

[wifi]
ssid=eduroam
mode=infrastructure
security=802-11-wireless-security

[wifi-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-eap

[802-1x]
eap=peap;
identity=PLACE_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE@PLACE_YOUR_INSTITUTION_DOMAIN_HERE
ca-cert=PLACE_YOUR_CERTIFICATE_HERE
phase2-auth=mschapv2
password=PLACE_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
private-key-password-flags=1
phase2-private-key-password-flags=1

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
method=auto
```

## Ethernet Setup

Out of the box, Ethernet should work without requiring any specific configuration for **Network Manager**. There are some instances where you may wish to customize your configuration, such as with sharing a network connection from a WiFi access point to another device connected with Ethernet.

Below is an example for sharing a network connection to another device attached by Ethernet:

```
[connection]
id=shared-ethernet
type=ethernet
interface-name=eth0

[ipv4]
method=shared

[ipv6]
method=shared
```

__Note:__ Ensure to specify the `interface-name`, for instance `eth0`.

By default, when an interface is shared, NetworkManager uses `10.42.x.0/24` as the `ipv4` subnet for the interface. This can be set manually by specifying the `address1` parameter manner within the `[ipv4]` block and specifying one address; for example: `address1=192.168.1.1`. [Read more][nm-ipv4-setting-ref]


## Regulatory Domain

By default, the WiFi regulatory domain for your device is not set until it is connected to a network. If you need your device to connect at first boot to channels that may be restricted in some countries, you can specify the regulatory domain in the `config.json` file (like the above WiFi settings, this is found in the boot partition). Regulatory domain is set using the `country` field.

As an example, if you are deploying your device in Great Britain and need it to connect to channel 12 or 13, you would set `"country":"GB"`.

## Setting a Static IP

Setting a static IP is possible by adding a few fields to the `[ipv4]` section of your connection file.

```
[connection]
id=my-ethernet
type=ethernet
interface-name=eth0
permissions=
secondaries=

[ethernet]
mac-address-blacklist=

[ipv4]
address1=192.168.1.111/24,192.168.1.1
dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;
dns-search=
method=manual

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
dns-search=
method=auto
```

The important bits to take note of here are `interface-name=eth0` which indicates which network interface to use and the `address1=192.168.1.111/24,192.168.1.1` line which shows we have a static IP of `192.168.1.111` and the network gateway is `192.168.1.1`. The final piece is to add the `dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;` line, which tell the device to use Google DNS. The set up for a WiFi connection is very much the same, as can be seen in the below example.

```
[connection]
id={{ $names.company.short }}-wifi
type=wifi

[wifi]
hidden=true
mode=infrastructure
ssid=PLACE_SSID_HERE

[ipv4]
address1=192.168.1.127/24,192.168.1.1
dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;
dns-search=
method=manual

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
method=auto

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=PLACE_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
```

## Creating a Hotspot

With **NetworkManager**, setting up your device as a hotspot is as simple as creating a `{{ $names.company.short }}-hotspot` file in `/system-connections/`:

```
[connection]
id={{ $names.company.short }}-hotspot
uuid=36060c57-aebd-4ccf-aba4-ef75121b5f77
type=wifi
autoconnect=true
interface-name=wlan0
permissions=
secondaries=

[wifi]
band=bg
mac-address-blacklist=
mac-address-randomization=0
mode=ap
seen-bssids=
ssid=PLACE_SSID_HERE

[wifi-security]
group=
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
pairwise=
proto=rsn
psk=PLACE_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

[ipv4]
dns-search=
method=shared

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
dns-search=
method=auto
```

This will create a WPA2/rsn hotspot, in case you need WPA protocol replace `proto=rsn` with `proto=` in section `[wifi-security]`.

## Cellular Modem Setup

For cellular or GSM based connections, {{ $names.os.lower }} makes use of **[ModemManager][modemmanager-link]** and is configured in much the same way as WiFi connections are configured. The connection profile can either be specified in your application code (see [Changing the Network at Runtime](#changing-the-network-at-runtime) below), or you can add a cellular configuration by adding a connection file to `/resin-boot/system-connections` in the downloaded {{ $names.os.lower }} `.img` file. In the future, cellular connections will be configurable from the dashboard at time of adding a device and downloading a {{ $names.os.lower }} image.

To set up a cellular connection with your device, just drop the below example configuration into a file in the `/resin-boot/system-connections/` directory in the `.img` or on SD card (if you have it flashed with the OS already) and name it something like `cellular`. Replace the `apn=` and `number=` values with your mobile providers APN and PPP dialing number. If your mobile carrier requires a password and username, you will need to add those as well. For a more in depth look at available settings options for GSM, have a look at `Table 58. gsm setting` in the [**NetworkManager** GSM settings reference][nm-gsm-setting-ref].

```
[connection]
id=cellular
type=gsm
autoconnect=true

[gsm]
apn=giffgaff.com
number=*99#
password=password
username=giffgaff

[serial]
baud=115200

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
method=auto
```

### Known Tested Modems

Check out the list of [balena supported modems][wifi-dongles]

## Changing the Network at Runtime

__Warning:__ Making changes to the networking of a device is extremely dangerous and can lead to a device being unrecoverable, so exercise caution with any of the following.

Often there are times where the WiFi network that the device will be provisioned into is not known beforehand. In these cases the device needs a mechanism to be able to add its own WiFi credentials during some kind of setup stage. For this reason we built the [WiFi Connect][wifi-connect] project.

WiFi Connect enables the device to create a wireless access point called `WiFi Connect` (also customizable) which serves a captive portal. This allows your end user to connect to the device and add their WiFi credentials. The device will then automatically leave the setup mode and connect to the specified user network.

Under the hood, WiFi Connect is interacting with **NetworkManager** via its [DBUS][dbus-link] API. The DBUS API is a useful way to interact with the {{ $names.os.lower }} host NetworkManager, and there are DBUS bindings for most languages. Below is a minimal Python example from the [**NetworkManager** examples][network-manager-examples], which creates a new **NetworkManager** connection file that can be used to enable connecting to a new WiFi access point.

__Note:__ You will need to install the `dbus` module in order to run this example (`apt-get install python-dbus`) and make sure `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket` is exported in the environment. This ensures that DBUS calls are directed to the system bus that the host OS is listening on rather than the DBUS bus in your container.

The following example will add a new WiFi connection file to your host OS **NetworkManager** configuration in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`. It should be noted that you will not see a new file created in `resin-boot/system-connections` because there isn't a two-way binding. On device boot, the files in `resin-boot/system-connections` are copied into `/mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` without removing any files from the destination. That directory is then bind mounted to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` in the root filesystem on the host.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import dbus, uuid, sys

## Change these values
SSID="<SSID>"
PASSWORD="<PASSWORD>"
##

s_con = dbus.Dictionary({
    'type': '802-11-wireless',
    'uuid': str(uuid.uuid4()),
    'id': SSID,
})

s_wifi = dbus.Dictionary({
    'ssid': dbus.ByteArray(bytes(SSID) if sys.version_info < (3, 0) else bytes(SSID, 'utf-8')),
    'mode': 'infrastructure',
    'hidden': dbus.Boolean(True),
})

s_wsec = dbus.Dictionary({
    'key-mgmt': 'wpa-psk',
    'auth-alg': 'open',
    'psk': PASSWORD,
})

s_ip4 = dbus.Dictionary({'method': 'auto'})
s_ip6 = dbus.Dictionary({'method': 'auto'})

con = dbus.Dictionary({
    'connection': s_con,
    '802-11-wireless': s_wifi,
    '802-11-wireless-security': s_wsec,
    'ipv4': s_ip4,
    'ipv6': s_ip6,
})


bus = dbus.SystemBus()

proxy = bus.get_object("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", "/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings")
settings = dbus.Interface(proxy, "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Settings")

settings.AddConnection(con)
```

The following example will print device name and all associated IPv4 addresses for each network device with an IPv4 connection.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import dbus
import ipaddress

bus = dbus.SystemBus()

# Get base NetworkManager dbus proxy
nm_proxy = bus.get_object("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", "/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager")
nm_props = dbus.Interface(nm_proxy, "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties")

# Enumerate all devices
devices = nm_props.Get("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", "Devices")
for device in devices:
    # Get dbus proxy for the device
    device_proxy = bus.get_object("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", device)
    device_props = dbus.Interface(device_proxy, "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties")

    # Get IPv4 configuration details
    ipv4_path = device_props.Get("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device", "Ip4Config")

    # Skip devices that do not have IPv4 configured
    if not ipv4_path or ipv4_path == "/":
        continue

    # Get dbus proxy for IPv4 configuration
    ipv4_proxy = bus.get_object("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", ipv4_path)
    ipv4_props = dbus.Interface(ipv4_proxy, "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties")

    # List all IPv4 addresses
    ipv4_addresses = ipv4_props.Get("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.IP4Config", "Addresses")
    addresses = []
    for address in ipv4_addresses:
        # address is an array where address[0] is the IPv4 address and address[1] is the netmask
        # The IPv4 addresses are returned as integers, we need to flip endianity
        addr_bytes = address[0].to_bytes(4, "little")
        addr = ipaddress.IPv4Address(addr_bytes)
        addresses.append("%s/%s" % (addr.compressed, address[1]))

    # Get device name
    device_name = device_props.Get("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device", "Interface")

    # Print all the information for a single device
    print("%s: %s" % (device_name, ", ".join(addresses)))
```

For other network setting needs, such as modifying existing network connection files, or listing connection information, please see the [**NetworkManager** examples][network-manager-examples].

__Warning:__ It can be dangerous to install **NetworkManager** or **python-networkmanager** in your container, especially if you have `INITSYSTEM=on`, as systemd will automatically try to start your container **NetworkManager** and this will take your devices offline. However, you can prevent this behavior by masking the **NetworkManager** service in your Dockerfile: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y network-manager && systemctl mask NetworkManager.service`.

__Note:__ The **python-networkmanager** Debian package depends on **NetworkManager**. Preferably **python-networkmanager** should be installed with **pip** instead of **apt-get**. That will avoid the issue described in the warning above and additionally the application container size will be kept minimal.

## NetworkManager User Scripts

NetworkManager dispatcher scripts are a powerful feature that allows you to customize the behavior of NetworkManager in response to specific network events. These scripts are executed by NetworkManager when events such as interface up or down, carrier changes, IP address changes, and connection status changes occur.

You can put [NetworkManager dispatch user scripts](https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/NetworkManager-dispatcher.html) in a folder named `/dispatcher.d/` on the boot partition. This is similar to how connection profiles can be placed in a folder named `/system-connections/` on the same boot partition.

During the device boot process, the files located in `/dispatcher.d/` are copied into the `/mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d` directory. After copying, the `/mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d` directory is bind mounted to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` in the root filesystem.

Following is an example usage of a dispatcher script provided from the [official nmcli usage examples](https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/nmcli-examples.html):

```text
#!/bin/bash
export LC_ALL=C

enable_disable_wifi ()
{
    result=$(nmcli dev | grep "ethernet" | grep -w "connected")
    if [ -n "$result" ]; then
        nmcli radio wifi off
    else
        nmcli radio wifi on
    fi
}

if [ "$2" = "up" ]; then
    enable_disable_wifi
fi

if [ "$2" = "down" ]; then
    enable_disable_wifi
fi
```

This specific dispatcher script ensures that when a wired interface is connected, the WiFi will be set to airplane mode. Conversely, when the wired interface is disconnected, WiFi will be turned back on. You may name the script `70-wifi-wired-exclusive.sh` and place it into the `/dispatcher.d/` directory on the boot partition.

## Network Requirements

In order for a {{ $names.company.lower }} device to get outside of the local network and connect to the {{ $names.company.lower }} API, there are a few core network requirements.

{{ $names.company.upper }} makes use of the following ports:

* `443` TCP - This is the most fundamental requirement - it is used to connect to Cloudlink and the web terminal, and many web endpoints using TLS (https://.)
* `123` UDP - For NTP time synchronization.
* `53` UDP - For DNS name resolution.

Each of these should work with outward only (and inward once outward connection established) firewall settings. Additionally, the NTP (`123`) and DNS (`53`) ports may be blocked if a local NTP and DNS server are provided.

Additionally, you should allowlist the following domains for the relevant ports above:
* `*.{{ $names.cloud_domain }}`

For older devices using `*.resin.io`, a `301 Moved Permanently` redirection to `*.{{ $names.cloud_domain }}` is in place so they remain compatible. Your systems should be able to handle this redirect so they can connect to the API.

Example:
```
$ curl -I http://api.resin.io
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:55:22 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 63
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://api.balena-cloud.com/
Vary: Accept
```

[Google's Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) server at 8.8.8.8 is used by
default and in addition to DNS servers obtained via DHCP from your local network or service provider (balenaOS may issue queries to multiple DNS servers simultaneously, for the quickest response to be used). If additional DNS servers are configured via DHCP or other means, it is OK for the local network to block requests to `8.8.8.8`.
To avoid any requests being made to `8.8.8.8` by balenaOS, modify the
[dnsServers setting]({{ $links.githubOS }}/meta-balena#dnsservers) in `config.json`.

__Note:__ {{>"general/country-firewall"}}

## Connecting Behind a Proxy

We use **[redsocks](https://github.com/darkk/redsocks)** to connect your device to {{ $names.company.lower }} from behind a proxy. There are two ways to enable redsocks proxy. The preferred method is through Supervisor's `GET/PATCH /v1/device/host-config` endpoints - more info may be found <a href="https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/#patch-v1devicehost-config" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Alternatively, a `redsocks.conf` file should be added at `/mnt/boot/system-proxy/`, specifying the needed proxy configuration:

```apache
base {
    log_debug = off;
    log_info = on;
    log = stderr;
    daemon = off;
    redirector = iptables;
}

redsocks {
    type = socks5;
    ip = <SERVER IP>;
    port = 8123;
    local_ip = 127.0.0.1;
    local_port = 12345;
    login = "<YOUR_USERNAME>";
	password = "<YOUR_PASSWORD>";
}
```

Note that:

- File logging (`log = "file:/var/log/redsocks";`) is not used. It will lead to permission problems.
- `daemon = off` is set, so that **redsocks** doesn’t fork.
- `local_port = 12345` is set, so that the iptables rules and **redsocks** port match.
- Available redsocks types include `socks4`, `socks5`, `http-connect`, and `http-relay`.

Additionally, a `/mnt/boot/system-proxy/no_proxy` file can be added with a newline-separated list of IPs or subnets to not route through the proxy.

We've published an example [here](https://github.com/balenalabs/proxy-tunnel) demonstrating how to implement this on devices.

## Checking connectivity

You can configure a connectivity check using NetworkManager's builtin [feature][nm-connectivity] (see "connectivity section"). In order to configure
custom endpoints, the URL, expected response, and check interval can be set in `config.json` (more information available
[here][meta-balena-connectivity]). By default, NetworkManager is configured to use {{ $names.cloud.lower }} to perform the check.

## Disable IPv6

In cases where a local network issue is preventing IPv6 traffic from being routed, you can fully disable IPv6 in {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.0 with the following commands.

__Warning:__ Making changes to the networking of a device is extremely dangerous and can lead to a device being unrecoverable, so exercise caution with any of the following.

```
root@087fd7c:/# nmcli c show
NAME                UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
Wired connection    087fd7cd-9a6b-423c-8b64-c30cbf6a7126  ethernet  eno1
...

root@087fd7c:~# nmcli c edit 087fd7cd-9a6b-423c-8b64-c30cbf6a7126

nmcli> set ipv6.method disable

nmcli> save persistent
Connection 'Wired connection' (087fd7cd-9a6b-423c-8b64-c30cbf6a7126) successfully updated.

nmcli> quit

root@087fd7c:~# nmcli c up 087fd7cd-9a6b-423c-8b64-c30cbf6a7126
```

To re-enable IPv6 follow the same commands but with `set ipv6.method enable`.

title: What is {{ $names.os.lower }}?

---

# What is {{ $names.os.lower }}?

## Introduction

{{ $names.os.upper }} is an operating system optimized for running [Docker][Docker] containers on embedded devices, with an emphasis on reliability over long periods of operation, as well as a productive developer workflow inspired by the lessons learned while building {{ $names.company.lower }}.

The core insight behind {{ $names.os.lower }} is that Linux containers offer, for the first time, a practical path to using virtualization on embedded devices. VMs and hypervisors have lead to huge leaps in productivity and automation for cloud deployments, but their abstraction of hardware, as well as their resource overhead and lack of hardware support, means that they are not suitable for embedded scenarios. With OS-level virtualization, as implemented for Linux containers, both those objections are lifted for Linux devices, of which there are many in the Internet of Things.

{{ $names.os.upper }} is an operating system built for easy portability to multiple device types (via the [Yocto framework][yocto] and optimized for Linux containers, and Docker in particular. There are many decisions, large and small, we have made to enable that vision, which are present throughout our architecture.

The first version of {{ $names.os.lower }} was developed as part of the {{ $names.company.lower }} platform, and has run on thousands of embedded devices on {{ $names.company.lower }}, deployed in many different contexts for several years. {{ $names.os.lower }} v2 represents the combination of the learnings we extracted over those years, as well as our determination to make {{ $names.os.lower }} a first-class open source project, able to run as an independent operating system, for any context where embedded devices and containers intersect.

We look forward to working with the community to grow and mature {{ $names.os.lower }} into an operating system with even broader device support, a broader operating envelope, and as always, taking advantage of the most modern developments in security and reliability.

### Development vs. Production mode

{{ $names.os.lower }} can be downloaded in production or development mode. This can be later changed via [developmentMode][config-json-developmentmode].

Development mode is recommended while getting started with {{ $names.os.lower }} and building an application using the fast [local mode][local-mode] workflow. Development mode enables a number of useful features while developing, namely:

* Passwordless [SSH access][ssh-host] into {{ $names.os.lower }} on port `22222` as the root user, unless custom [ssh keys][config-json-ssh] are provided in which case key-based authentication is used.
* Docker socket exposed on port `2375`, which allows `{{ $names.company.lower }} push` / `build` / `deploy`, that enables remote Docker builds on the target device (see [Deploy to your Fleet][deploy-to-fleet]).
* Getty console attached to tty1 and serial.
* Capable of entering [local mode][local-mode] for rapid development of application containers locally.

__Note:__ Raspberry Pi devices don’t have Getty attached to serial by default, but they can be configured to enable serial in the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} Dashboard via [configuration variables][supervisor-configuration-list].

__Warning:__ Development mode has an exposed Docker socket and enable passwordless root SSH access and should never be used in production.

Production mode disables passwordless root access, and an SSH key must be [added][config-json-ssh] to `config.json` to access a production image using a direct SSH connection. You may still access a production image by tunneling SSH through the cloudlink via the CLI (using `balena ssh <uuid>`) or the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} [web terminal][ssh-host]. To use SSH via cloudlink, you need to have an SSH key configured on your development machine and [added][ssh-key-add] to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard.

### Logging

In {{ $names.os.lower }}, logs are written to an 8 MB journald RAM buffer in order to avoid wear on the flash storage used by most of the supported boards.

To persist logs on the device, enable persistent logging via the [configuration][fleet-configuration] tab in the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard, or prior to device provisioning setting the `"persistentLogging": true` [key][config-json-logging] in `config.json`. The logs can be accessed via the host OS at `/var/log/journal`. For versions of {{ $names.os.lower }} < 2.45.0, persistent logs are limited to 8 MB and stored in the state partition of the device. {{ $names.os.upper }} versions >= 2.45.0 store a maximum of 32 MB of persistent logs in the data partition of the device.

### Hostname

{{ $names.os.lower }} allows the setting of a custom [hostname][config-json-hostname] via `config.json`, by setting `"hostname": "my-new-hostname"`. Your device will then broadcast (via Avahi) on the network as `my-new-hostname.local`. If you don't set a custom hostname, the device hostname will default to `<short-UUID>`. You can also set a custom hostname via the [Supervisor API][supervisor-api] on device.

### Logo

On production mode, nothing is written to tty1, on boot you should only see the {{ $names.company.lower }} logo, and this will persist until your application code takes over the framebuffer. If you would like to replace the {{ $names.company.lower }} logo with your own custom splash logo, then you will need to replace the `splash/balena-logo.png` file that you will find in the [first partition][partition] of the image (boot partition or `resin-boot`) with your own logo.

__Note:__ As it currently stands, plymouth expects the image to be named `balena-logo.png`. This file was called `resin-logo.png` on older releases.

### Provisioning keys

When a {{ $names.os.lower }} image is downloaded from the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard, it contains a provisioning key that allows devices flashed with the image to be added to a specific fleet, and a device API key generated. As such, you should handle such images downloaded from {{ $names.cloud.lower }} with care as anyone with access to the image can add a device to your fleet. You can find out more about the access restrictions of a device API key [here][security].

### Standalone {{ $names.os.lower }}

Images downloaded via the CLI (using `os download`), via [balena.io/os][balena-io-os], or [manually built via Yocto][yocto-build] are the same {{ $names.os.lower }} images as those downloaded from {{ $names.cloud.lower }} but are unconfigured, and will not connect to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} servers, but still make use of the Supervisor to keep the containers running. This version of {{ $names.os.lower }} is meant as an excellent way to get started with Docker containers on embedded systems, and you can read more about this at [balena.io/os][balena-io-os].

Should you wish to add an unconfigured device to your {{ $names.cloud.lower }} fleet, you may migrate it using the interactive `balena join` [CLI command][cli-join] or update the `config.json` of an unconfigured device with a configuration file downloaded from the _Add device_ page of the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard.

## {{ $names.os.upper }} Components

 The {{ $names.os.lower }} userspace packages only provide the bare essentials for running containers, while still offering flexibility. The philosophy is that software and services always default to being in a container unless they are generically useful to all containers, or they absolutely can’t live in a container. The userspace consists of many open source components, but in this section, we will highlight some of the most important services.

![{{ $names.os.upper }} Components](/img/common/balenaos/balenaOS-components.webp)

### systemd

[systemd][systemd] is the init system of {{ $names.os.lower }}, and it is responsible for launching and managing all the other services. {{ $names.os.upper }} leverages many of the great features of systemd, such as adjusting OOM scores for critical services and running services in separate mount namespaces. systemd also allows us to manage service dependencies easily.

### Supervisor

The {{ $names.lower.company }} Supervisor is a lightweight container that runs on devices. Its main roles are to ensure your app is running, and keep communications with the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API server, downloading new application containers and updates to existing containers as you push them in addition to sending logs to your dashboard. It also provides an [API interface][supervisor], which allows you to query the update status and perform certain actions on the device.

### {{ $names.engine.upper }}

[{{ $names.engine.upper}}][balena-engine] is {{ $names.company.lower }}'s modified Docker daemon fork that allows the management and running of service images, containers, volumes, and networking. {{ $names.engine.upper }} supports container deltas for 10-70x more efficient bandwidth usage, has 3.5x smaller binaries, uses RAM and storage more conservatively, and focuses on atomicity and durability of container pulling.

### NetworkManager and Modem Manager

{{ $names.os.upper }} uses [NetworkManager][network-manager] accompanied by [ModemManager][modem-manager], to deliver a stable and reliable connection to the internet, be it via ethernet, WiFi or cellular modem. Additionally, to make headless configuration of the device’s network easy, there is a `system-connections` folder in the boot partition, which is copied into `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`. So any valid NetworkManager connection file can just be dropped into the boot partition before device commissioning.

### Avahi

In order to improve the [development experience][local-mode] of {{ $names.os.lower }}, there is an [Avahi][avahi] daemon that starts advertising the device on boot as `<short-UUID>.local` or `<hostname>.local` if the hostname is set.
Avahi listens on UDP port `5353` for mDNS traffic. It also uses ephemeral (“random”) ports to receive replies to unicast DNS queries.

### Dnsmasq

[Dnsmasq][dnsmasq] manages the nameservers that NetworkManager provides for {{ $names.os.lower }}. NetworkManager discovers the nameservers that can be used, and a binary called `resolvconf` writes them to a tmpfs location, from where Dnsmasq will take over and manage these nameservers to give the user the fastest most responsive DNS resolution.

### chrony

__Note__: {{ $names.os.upper }} versions less than v2.13.0 used systemd-timesyncd for time management.

[chrony][chrony] is used by {{ $names.os.lower }} to keep the system time synchronized.

### OpenVPN

[OpenVPN][open-vpn] is used as the VPN service by {{ $names.os.lower }}, which connects to cloudlink, allowing a device to be connected to remotely and enabling remote SSH access.

### OpenSSH

__Note__: {{ $names.os.upper }} versions < v2.38.0 use [dropbear][dropbear] as the SSH server and client

[OpenSSH][open-ssh] is used in {{ $names.os.lower }} as the SSH server and client allowing remote login using the SSH protocol.

## Image Partition Layout

![Image partition layout](/img/common/balenaos/image-partition-layout.webp)

The first partition, `resin-boot`, holds important boot files according to each board (e.g. kernel image, bootloader image). It also holds the `config.json` file, which is the central point of [configuring {{ $names.os.lower }}][config-json] and defining its behavior. For example using `config.json` you can set your hostname, add SSH keys, allow persistent logging or define custom DNS servers.

`resin-rootA` is the partition that holds the read-only root filesystem; it holds almost everything that {{ $names.os.lower }} is.

`resin-rootB` is an empty partition that is only used when the rootfs is to be updated. We follow the A-B update strategy for  {{ $names.os.lower }} upgrades. Essentially, we have one active partition that is the OS’s current rootfs and one dormant one that is empty. During a {{ $names.os.lower }} [update][hostos-updates] we download the new rootfs to the dormant partition and try to switch them. If the switch is successful the dormant partition becomes the new rootfs, if not, we roll back to the old active partition.

`resin-state` is the partition that holds persistent data, as explained in the [Stateless and Read-only rootfs](#stateless-and-read-only-rootfs) section.

`resin-data` is the storage partition that contains the Supervisor and application containers and volumes.

## Stateless and Read-Only rootFS

{{ $names.os.upper }} comes with a read-only root filesystem, so we can ensure our host OS is stateless, but we still need some data to be persistent over system reboots. We achieve this with a very simple mechanism, i.e. bind mounts.

{{ $names.os.upper }} contains a partition named `resin-state` that is meant to hold all this persistent data. Inside we populate a Linux filesystem hierarchy standard with the rootfs paths that we require to be persistent. After this partition is populated, we are ready to bind mount the respective rootfs paths to this read-write location, thus allowing different components (e.g. `journald`, when persistent logging is enabled) to be able to write data to disk.

A diagram of our read-only rootfs can be seen below:

![Read only rootFS](/img/common/balenaos/read-only-rootfs.webp)

## {{ $names.os.upper }} Yocto Composition

{{ $names.os.upper }} is composed of multiple [Yocto][yocto] layers. The Yocto Project build system uses these layers to compile {{ $names.os.lower }} for the various [supported devices](/reference/hardware/devices/). Below is an example from the [Raspberry Pi family][raspberry-pi-conf].

__Note:__ Instructions for building your own version of {{ $names.os.lower }} are available [here][yocto-build].

At the base is [Poky][yocto-poky], the Yocto Project's reference distribution. Poky contains the OpenEmbedded Build System (BitBake and OpenEmbedded-Core) as well as a set of metadata.  On top of Poky, we add the collection of packages from meta-openembedded.

The next layer adds the Board Support Package (BSP). This layer provides board-specific configuration and packages (e.g., bootloader and kernel), thus enabling building for physical hardware (not emulators).

The core code of {{ $names.os.lower }} resides in the meta-{{ $names.company.lower }}-common layer. This layer also needs a Poky version-specific layer (e.g., meta-{{ $names.company.lower }}-warrior) based on the requirements of the BSP layer.

Next is the board-specific meta-{{ $names.company.lower }} configuration layer. This layer works in conjunction with a BSP layer. For example, the Raspberry Pi family is supported by the meta-raspberrypi BSP layer and the corresponding meta-{{ $names.company.lower }}-raspberrypi layer configures {{ $names.os.lower }} to the Raspberry Pi's needs

The final meta-rust layer enables support for the rust compiler and the cargo package manager.

# Setup secure boot and full disk encryption for Generic x86_64 (GPT)

This section describes how to setup a device with secure boot and full disk encryption using `Generic x86_64 (GPT)` {{ $names.os.lower }} image. This image should be compatible on a wide range of x86_64 devices. Note that `Generic x86-64 (legacy MBR)` and `Intel NUC` images do not provide secure boot and full disk encryption. 


Before diving into how to provision a device with secure boot and full disk encryption, let's look at some important considerations around this feature specifically for x86_64 devices.  For more information on the general approach to secure boot, see our docs on a [general overview of our secure boot and full disk encryption implementation][general-sb-fde-overview].


## Important Considerations and Caveats

- {{ $names.os.upper }} does not use the shim first stage bootloader that other Linux distributions do and is usually signed with Microsoft platform keys. {{ $names.os.upper }} is an embedded distribution, and when secure boot is enabled only {{ $names.company.lower }} signed operating systems are allowed to boot.
- Disk encryption and decryption is unattended - there is no user interaction when mounting the encrypted disks as it is expected from an embedded device. 
- Secure boot and disk encryption have been designed to work as a bundle in {{ $names.os.lower }} and they cannot be configured separately.
- Only system partitions are encrypted. Any extra storages are not encrypted.
- OS images are signed images and {{ name.company.lower }} manages a secure signing server. We currently use a single key for the platform and consequently we can never provide the key to end users. You can read further on [how we handle keys][key-management-approach].
- It is not possible to configure GRUB or kernel parameters
- There are [other trade-offs][other-considerations] pertaining to debugging and system configuration.



## System requirements

- **Secure Element: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0**

    To use secure boot and full disk encryption, your device must have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 which is the [secure element][secure-element] on x86_64 devices. For initial setup, the TPM must be in a mode that allows enrolling new keys, often called "Setup Mode" in the BIOS/UEFI settings. While most modern x86_64 devices support this, some models may be locked into "Deployed Mode," which prevents key enrollment and is therefore incompatible.

    Moreover, TPMs can be of two types:
    - Firmware TPM (fTPM): The TPM is integrated directly into the main CPU's firmware.
    - Discrete TPM (dTPM): The TPM is a separate, physical chip on the motherboard, external to the CPU.

    While {{ $names.os.lower }} technically supports both, we **only** recommend using devices with a firmware TPM (fTPM) for deployments requiring secure boot and disk encryption. The primary reason we advise against using discrete TPMs (dTPMs) is the physical security risk they introduce. A dTPM communicates with the CPU over a bus on the motherboard, typically using protocols like SPI or I2C. This external communication path creates a potential attack vector, which is not present in fTPM.

- **The device should support Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)**

- **Persist UEFI settings for the expected lifetime of the device**

    As a necessary part of the provisioning process, customers will almost certainly change some UEFI settings to non-default values. The customer should test that these settings will persist for the expected lifetime of their device. For instance, customers should use an RTC / CMOS battery that will endure through the expected lifetime of the device. Note that extended periods without AC / mains power will shorten the life of an RTC battery.

## Setup

There are two steps required to install a secure boot enabled and disk encrypted system:

- Opt-in secure boot mode in the {{ $names.os.lower }} installer
- Configure the device’s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware for secure boot and setup mode

Note that {{ $names.os.lower }} currently does not support updating from a non-secure boot enabled system into a secure boot enabled one. The only way to install a secure boot and disk encrypted system at this moment is by using a {{ $names.os.lower }} installer image.


### Configuring {{ $names.os.lower }} image to opt-in secure boot mode

`Generic x86_64 (GPT)` {{ $names.os.lower }} images ship with the capability to provision a device with secure boot and full disk encryption. While the feature was introduced in {{ $names.os.lower }} `v2.114.21`, it has since been has been hardened for security and updated for broader device compatibility in version `v6.6.1`. {{ $names.company.upper }} recommends that all customers use the most recent releases.


#### Using {{ $names.cloud.lower }}

1. Add a device to your fleet. You should be presented with the following new option:

<img alt="Add a device modal with secure boot and full disk encryption modal" src="/img/common/sb-fde/x86/add-device-modal-sb-fde-x86.webp" width="100%">

2. As mentioned, there are [important considerations and caveats][considerations-caveats] when enabling secure boot and full disk encryption. You will be presented with the following disclaimer when enabling the feature:

<img alt="Warning for considerations when enabling secure boot and full disk encryption" src="/img/common/sb-fde/x86/sb-fde-x86-disclaimer.webp" width="100%">

 You can optionally surpress the disclaimer by selecting "Don't show me this warning again for this device type".

 You can then proceed to download the configured image.

 #### Using {{ $names.cli.lower }} 

{{ $names.cli.upper }} versions `16.2.0` or newer allow you to [configure](https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/#os-configure-image) a {{ $names.os.lower }} installer image to opt-in secure boot by using the following command:

````
balena os configure <image> --secureBoot --version <version> --fleet <fleetName> --device-type generic-amd64

````

### Flash the image to a USB key

The configured image should be flashed to a USB key.

- Insert the USB key into your laptop or computer.
- Write the {{ $names.os.lower }} file you downloaded to the USB key. We recommend using Etcher.
- Wait for writing of {{ $names.os.lower }} to complete.
- Remove the USB key from the host machine.
- Insert the freshly flashed USB key into the Generic x86_64 (GPT).

### Provision the device

Once the image is ready, the device needs to be configured in secure boot setup mode. This depends on the UEFI/BIOS implementation, but in general there are the following steps to consider:

- Reset to the default UEFI configuration.
- Make sure the device is configured to boot in UEFI mode, for example by checking the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) used for Master Boot Record (MBR) booting is disabled.
- Change the boot options to allow booting only from the USB installer/flasher device and the main storage, and choose the USB as first boot option. The flasher will then set the UEFI configuration to boot from the main storage before rebooting.
- Disable restoring factory keys. Some systems default to restoring factory (Microsoft) keys rather than using the {{ $names.company.lower }} keys that will be installed during setup.
- Enable secure boot.
- Reset device to setup mode

On booting in setup mode, the installer will enroll the keys into UEFI variables and encrypt the disks using the TPM device. Note that enrolling the keys manually via the UEFI setup application, while possible on some systems, is not currently supported by {{ $names.os.lower }} as the installer’s bootloader is not signed.

Wait for the device to finish flashing and shutdown. Please wait until all LEDs are off. You can then remove the USB key from the device and turn on the device again. 

The device should show up on {{ $names.cloud.lower }}.

### Checking if it worked

__Note__ We are working on adding support for the device to report it's secure boot and full disk encryption status to {{ $names.cloud.lower }}. In the meantime, you can use the following instructions to manually check the status.

1. SSH into the hostOS [using the dashboard web terminal][ssh-dashboard-terminal] or [using the CLI][ssh-cli] 
2. Run the following command to check if secure boot is enabled:

```
source /usr/libexec/os-helpers-sb
is_secured && echo "secured" || echo "not secured"
```

The above command returns `secured` if secure boot is enabled and the device is in user mode.
3. Run the following command to check if the disks are encrypted:

```
mount | grep luks
```
You should see a similar output as below:

````
/dev/mapper/luks-ac97b9b4-8708-4095-bf2d-484ab8fd66b9 on /mnt/sysroot/active type ext4 (rw,relatime)

title: Secure Boot and Full Disk Encryption
excerpt: General overview of balena's secure boot and full disk encryption implementation
---

# Secure Boot and Full Disk Encryption
{{ $names.company.upper }}’s secure boot and full disk encryption feature addresses two critical aspects of device security. Secure boot ensures that only trusted software can run on the device, while full disk encryption safeguards data at rest by preventing unauthorized access to the contents of storage media. 

Given the diversity of hardware platforms that {{ $names.os.lower }} targets, it was essential to design a flexible framework capable of integrating device-specific secure boot mechanisms. 

Key goals of {{ $names.os.lower }} secure boot and encryption design include:

- Flexible hardware integration: Support a wide variety of architectures and device types.
- Use of {{ $names.company.lower }}-specific keys: Avoid depending on third-party-signed shims (e.g., Microsoft keys) by default.
- Unattended unlocking: Eliminate the need for user-supplied secrets (like passphrases) at boot.
- Seamless updates and rollbacks: Retain the existing {{ $names.os.lower }} capability of rolling back to a known-good state if an update fails.

Owing to the design constraints above, a secured device uses both secure boot and disk encryption - these two functionalities are not provided separately.



## Keys and Certificates in Secure Boot
Secure boot depends fundamentally on cryptographic keys and certificates to verify the integrity of every component in the boot process.

These typically include:
- **Signing Keys** : A private key signs the bootloader, kernel, and other critical binaries.
This key must be kept confidential; anyone possessing it can produce binaries that devices would trust.
- **Public Certificates or keys** : The matching public certificate (or key) is stored on the device.
When the device attempts to execute a signed binary (e.g., the bootloader or kernel), a cryptographic check ensures the signature is valid.

Secure Boot-enabled {{ $names.os.lower }} images are provided pre-signed using **{{ $names.company.lower }}-owned** secrets - this is a convenient way to guarantee that only trusted software runs in the device while avoiding the friction of secrets generation, managing and safeguarding.

__Note:__ We are aware that {{ $names.company.lower }} owned keys might not fit all use cases. Unique customer keys can also be used as an extra service. Contact [sales@balena.io](mailto:sales@balena.io) to discuss further.

## Secure Element
A secure element is a tamper-resistant, isolated environment within a device's hardware, designed to protect cryptographic keys and perform sensitive operations securely.
{{ $names.company.upper }} **only** recommends using devices with secure elements that are embedded directly into the System on a Chip (SoC). This integrated approach is preferred over solutions that rely on external, discrete chips, as embedded elements are significantly less vulnerable to physical tampering and sophisticated hardware attacks. The specific implementation varies by hardware - for detailed information, always refer to the official technical reference manual for your particular device.

## Provisioning a secured device

Provisioning a device with secure boot and full disk encryption enabled typically involves the following high-level processes:

- Enroll secure boot keys into the device
- Generate a unique disk encryption key and uses it to encrypt the storage
- Program {{ $names.os.lower }} into storage
- Lock the device into secure boot mode

### Secure Boot Installer Images
Typically, {{ $names.os.lower }} images can be categorized as:
- **Non-flasher images** : The internal storage of a device is programmed directly with {{ $names.os.lower }} using a live image
- **Flasher images**: Used when the devices did not expose the internal storage. The flasher image boots from an external storage medium and then the os is programmed to the required internal storage 

All secure boot-enabled devices have flasher images. Moreover, given that the image not only writes the os to disk but also does other tasks such as enrolling required keys and certificates, they can be considered as `installer` images. So, secure boot enabled devices provide an `installer` image instead that can be programmed either on external or internal storage, in the latter case running from memory and performing the installation on the same disk it is booted from.

The secure boot installer is itself using signed binaries and can be used to re-program locked devices. Re-running the installer will irrevocably lose all data on the disks as the encryption key is erased.


__Note:__ This imposes a limitation on the specifications for device types to support secure boot - they must have enough memory to hold the raw image that is being programmed into disk. BalenaOS reduces this restriction by using compressed memory to hold the raw image, but still, memory constrained devices will not be able to support secure boot with the current design. 


### Partition Layout and Disk Encryption
Balena uses the `dm-crypt` Linux kernel subsystem and `device-mapper` framework to encrypt block devices. Balena supports both direct `dm-crypt` and `LUKS` (Linux Unified Key Setup) - the actual system used depends on the device type's vendor implementation.

A secure boot installation also alters the default {{ $names.os.lower }} partition table as the boot partition is split into two:
- An unencrypted boot partition which contains the signed {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader binary and other essential artifacts needed to run it.
- An encrypted boot partition that mounts in the traditional `/mnt/boot` path and contains all other artifacts, including confidential files like `config.json` which contains API keys.


## Boot Chain of Trust

The notion of a chain of trust arises because each stage in the boot process validates the integrity of the subsequent stage before executing it. If at any point a link in this chain is corrupted, unsigned, or otherwise fails validation, the boot process halts or reverts to a known-good state. This sequential validation ensures that if the first link is trusted, every subsequent link remains trustworthy, preventing unauthorized or tampered code from ever running.

<img alt="balenaOS secure boot generic chain of trust" src="/img/common/sb-fde/balenaos-sb-fde-chain-of-trust.webp" width="100%">


The root of trust is always the device’s `bootROM`. `bootROM` refers to the very first piece of firmware that runs when a device powers on. It resides in read-only memory (ROM) that is physically embedded in the processor or system-on-chip (SoC). Because the code stored in bootROM is difficult or impossible to modify (without physically altering the chip), it serves as the hardware-enforced starting point or “root of trust” for the boot process. 

Key responsibilities of a bootROM include:

- **Initializing critical hardware**: Setting up CPU registers, clocks, and memory controllers in order to begin loading higher-level software.
- **Locating and verifying the next boot stage**: Often checks for cryptographic signatures or checksums on the bootloader (or other initial executables) to ensure they have not been tampered with.
- **Passing control to a validated bootloader**: Once signature verification succeeds, execution is handed off to the bootloader, continuing the chain of trust.

A typical boot chain of trust for {{ $names.os.lower }} involves:
- The `bootROM` validates the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader and device trees and executes the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader
- The {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader mounts the encrypted storage, validates the appropriate Linux kernel plus initramfs using in-kernel `X.509` certificates
- The {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader then `kexec`s into the Linux kernel
- The Linux kernel validates kernel modules on load using the in-kernel `X.509` certificates

Some devices, like `UEFI`-based ones, are able to directly load the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader as an `EFI` artifact. Others need to use a vendor bootloader like `U-Boot` as a first stage which then loads and authenticates the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader.

### Balena Bootloader

The {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader addresses several challenges unique to {{ $names.os.lower }}’s partitioning and update model:

**Single FAT32 Boot Partition**
BalenaOS typically includes a single `FAT32` boot partition to facilitate configuration changes (such as editing config.json via the balenaCLI) and support a wide range of bootloaders. However, updating the bootloader on this partition during a hostOS update carries inherent risk: an unexpected power loss could render the device unbootable.

**Minimal Bootloader Updates**
Conventional bootloaders are generally designed to remain small and rarely updated. On secure boot–enabled devices, the Linux kernel resides outside the boot partition—in a redundant root partition—allowing safe kernel updates without risking device bricking during power interruptions.

**Encrypted Partition Support**
Standard bootloaders like GRUB or U-Boot often lack native support for mounting encrypted partitions. Because {{ $names.os.lower }} secures its kernel in encrypted storage, the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader must incorporate decryption capabilities to load the kernel securely.

**Unified Configuration and Rollback Mechanism**
The {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader centralizes configuration across diverse hardware platforms and includes hostOS update rollback logic. This approach simplifies hardware bring-up by using vendor bootloaders as unmodified first-stage loaders while relying on the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader for secure disk access and validated kernel loading.

The {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader mounts and decrypts the appropriate root partition and then loads and authenticates the Linux kernel. 

### Linux Kernel and Initramfs

BalenaOS uses kexec within the {{ $names.company.lower }} bootloader to transition control from the initial boot stage to the final Linux kernel. In this architecture, the Linux kernel is compiled to embed an initramfs, which contains the necessary logic to:

- Mount encrypted storage partitions.
- Mount the container filesystem that holds the hostOS root filesystem.
- Perform a root switch into the running init process (which in {{ $names.os.lower }} is managed by `systemd`).

`Kexec` authentication relies on an `X.509` certificate (`RSA 4096-bit`, `SHA-256`) that is bundled with the kernel at compile time. This certificate:

- Authenticates the final kernel during the `kexec` procedure, verifying its integrity before execution.
- Validates kernel modules on load, ensuring only trusted, signed modules become part of the running kernel.

In the current design, the chain of trust essentially ends at the kernel. The root partition and userspace is not signed and verified.

### Root Filesystem Integrity
BalenaOS’s chain of trust ends with the Linux kernel, as the root filesystem itself is not signed. While this means the filesystem cannot be authenticated in its entirety at runtime, all partitions are encrypted, preventing tampering at rest. The operating system strictly refuses to mount partitions that are either unencrypted or encrypted with unknown credentials. Consequently, any modifications to the filesystem content would be detectable through decryption failures or mismatch in encryption keys.

### Application Authentication
Currently, applications (container images) are not cryptographically signed. However, only a fully verified operating system (one that has passed secure boot checks) is permitted to install new applications. Furthermore, the following add another layer of security:
- the manifest (target state) can only come from balenaCloud API via a `HTTPS/TLS` connection
- container images themselves are downloaded exclusively and securely  from balenaCloud’s authenticated registry over `HTTPS/TLS` and reference the image with the exact hash
- if the hash of the image or any of its layers doesn't match, the pull fails and the image is not run

We strongly recommend following security best practices to ensure a robust security posture. This includes properly managing secrets, tokens, and credentials to prevent unauthorized access, as well as implementing rigorous network security measures such as firewalls, secure communication protocols, and regular monitoring for potential threats. 

## Other considerations

### Loading out-of-tree kernel modules
All the kernel modules need to be signed with a trusted key. At this moments we only sign the module at build time so only the out-of-tree modules that we build and ship as a part of {{ $names.os.lower }} are properly signed. Loading user-built kernel modules requires building custom software and is an extra service available on demand. Contact [sales@balena.io](mailto:sales@balena.io) to discuss further.

### Debugging
It is important to understand that due to the nature of the feature, not all debugging procedures are available. Some of the more common ones are:

- A device in production mode will not accept any input or produce any output (screen/keyboard/serial) unless the user application sets it up. This makes it nearly impossible to debug early boot process failures (bootloader/kernel). A device in development mode will still start getty but only after the system gets all the way to userspace.
- It is not possible to tamper with bootloader configuration, which includes changing kernel parameters or other boot configurations.
- Since the encryption keys can only be accessed on the device itself after authenticated booting, it is neither possible to remove the storage media and mount/inspect it on a different device nor boot off a temporary boot media on the same device.
- Some features of the kernel are not available due to it being in lockdown mode. See [`man 7 kernel_lockdown`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/kernel_lockdown.7.html) for details.

excerpt: How time is synchronized and managed for {{ $names.company.lower }} devices
---
# Time management

__Note:__ Starting from {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.13.1 the `chrony` service is used for time management. Prior versions of {{ $names.os.lower }} use `systemd-timesyncd`.

Devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} make use of the `chrony` (or `systemd-timesyncd`) service to keep the system time synchronized. That service is running in the host OS, independent of the application containers.

It is important that the date and time are set correctly, as an inaccurate date can manifest itself as several different issues on the device, such as SSL/TLS certificates appearing invalid. If you want to query the current time on the device, you can do so by using the `date` utility or the datetime related functions of the standard library of your language.

```shell
$ date
Tue Mar  3 19:59:54 UTC 2020
```

{{ $names.company.upper }} devices use [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) as their standard time zone. If you want to use a timezone other than UTC, you have to explicitly set the timezone for the operating system running within your container. To set the timezone on the container, find the name of your timezone from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List), and set an environment variable called `TZ` with that value. This can be done either in the Dockerfile (hardcoded) by `ENV TZ <value>` or a new variable called `TZ` in the [dashboard][env-vars] with the value as the timezone you want to set. This will only work if `tzdata` package is installed in the container image. Refer to [balena-timezone]({{ $links.githubPlayground }}/balena-timezone) project for an example on setting the timezone in the container. The {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard shows log timestamps using the local time for the browser you are viewing it on, and you can switch it to display the timestamps in UTC by using the toggle available in the log view.

![Change the logs to use UTC timezone](/img/common/main_dashboard/dashboard-utc.webp)

If you want to learn if the system has completed at least one successful NTP synchronization since boot, you can use D-Bus from within your container. Check the "[Checking if device time is NTP synchronized](/runtime/runtime/#checking-if-device-time-is-ntp-synchronized)" example. The `NTPSynchronized` property will indicate if the device is running with a potentially stale clock or if the system time is synced.

[chrony][chrony] is an implementation of the [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol). The chrony daemon `chronyd` is [configured](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/doc/3.5/chrony.conf.html) via the `/etc/chrony.conf` file.  The default `chrony.conf` file used in {{$names.os.lower}} can be viewed [here]({{ $links.githubOS }}/meta-balena/blob/master/meta-balena-common/recipes-core/chrony/files/chrony.conf).

Requests are sent to the supplied NTP sources approximately every four and a half hours (as specified by the `minpoll` and `maxpoll` directives). For the device's initial sync, the first four requests are sent at an interval of two seconds or less, before transitioning to the approximate four and half hour polling interval.

__Note:__ {{$names.os.upper}} < 2.46.1 uses chrony defaults for `minpoll` (64 seconds) and `maxpoll` (1024 seconds) as opposed to the current value (16384 seconds).

The estimated drift of the system clock is saved to a driftfile located at `/var/lib/chrony/drift`. This allows `chronyd` to begin compensating the system clock at that rate whenever it is restarted. This driftfile is updated when the time is synchronized, and on exit, at most once per hour.

### chronyc

`chronyc` is a command-line utility that can be used to interoperate with `chronyd`. `chronyc` has [commands][chronyc] to see how `chronyd` is performing and identify any potential [issues](#networking-requirements) preventing synchronization. For example:

* `chronyc sources` - A list of all the current NTP sources being used by the NTP daemon, which will also indicate if they are reachable.
* `chronyc tracking` - Information about the system clock itself, including skew.
* `chronyc ntpdata` - Detailed information on all the current NTP sources.

## systemd-timesyncd

__Note:__ This section is only applicable to {{ $names.os.lower }} versions < 2.13.1.

When the {{ $names.company.lower }} device boots up, and before any container is run, the system will query the hardware clock to get the current time, while it will also read the timestamp value, stored in the last modification time of a special file, `/var/lib/systemd/clock`. If the hardware clock is behind the value stored with `/var/lib/systemd/clock`, the system will forcefully set the clock to the stored value. This is done to ensure that time from the point of view of the applications is monotonically increasing. After that, the device will start its Network Time Protocol (NTP) client, which will be attempting to sync the clock with NTP servers periodically. If a successful synchronization occurs, the last modification time of `/var/lib/systemd/clock` is updated to that timestamp.

When you first provision a device, as a fallback, `/var/lib/systemd/clock` is set to the timestamp of the host OS build (or more precisely, the timestamp of the systemd build within the host OS). For more info, you can check the [`systemd-timesyncd` documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-timesyncd.service.html) and the [timesyncd source code](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/timesync/timesyncd.c).

## Networking Requirements

There are certain networking requirements to ensure that the NTP service can properly function, and the device time may be kept synchronized.

The NTP service requires UDP port `123` to be open for outgoing connections from the device. See more [network requirements here](/deployment/network/2.0.0/#network-requirements).

Starting from {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.0.7, the devices connect to the following NTP servers:

* 0.resinio.pool.ntp.org
* 1.resinio.pool.ntp.org
* 2.resinio.pool.ntp.org
* 3.resinio.pool.ntp.org

To be clear, `ntp.org` uses a large pool of servers that change frequently. So UDP port `123` must be open outgoing to all hosts.

You can configure your own NTP servers in the [`config.json` file][config-json] location in the [boot partition][boot-partition]. For example:

```json
"ntpServers": "0.resinio.pool.ntp.org 1.resinio.pool.ntp.org"
```

Starting from {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.30.0, NTP servers can be set over DHCP.

# Self-service updates

## Which devices and versions are supported?

Since we periodically release updates and improvements to {{ $names.os.lower }} (the host OS running on all {{ $names.company.lower }} devices), we encourage you to keep your devices up to date. We offer self-service host OS updates between 2.x versions and from 1.x to 2.x versions. All 2.x devices will default to delta-based updates if available, thus reducing the size of the update sent over the network.

__Note:__ {{ $names.os.upper }} 1.x to 2.x updates limit the amount of data you can have in your application's `/data` folder to about 170MB (compressed). If you have more data, the update will fail and your device won't be modified.

Self-service updates are available for both `production` and `development` {{ $names.os.lower }} variants.

For device types and {{ $names.os.lower }} versions that are not yet supported, please contact us on the [forums][forums]. We are continuously expanding the range of versions and types that can be updated.

## Running an update

To run an update for an individual device, navigate to that device's *Settings* tab, go to the section *OS version*, and select the version of {{ $names.os.lower }} you would like to update to. After making your selection, click the *Save* button.

![Update device](/img/common/updates/update-os.webp)

Updates can also be made to multiple devices in the same fleet. From the device list, click the checkbox to the left of any online devices you wish to update. Then use the *Modify* dropdown to choose the *OS version* option to set and trigger an update on all selected devices.

![Device group update](/img/common/updates/group-update.webp)

From the dialog box that opens, select the OS version you would like to update to and click the `Apply` button to trigger the OS update. 

![device group update, dialog box](/img/common/updates/group-update-dialog.webp)

__Note:__ Updates to the balena Supervisor, {{ $names.company.lower }}'s agent on the device, can be [triggered independently](/reference/supervisor/supervisor-upgrades).

After an update begins, the device summary page will show a progress bar that marks the steps completed for the update. Some steps that take longer, such as the device downloading the new OS image, may make the progress bar appear stuck. This doesn't mean anything has gone wrong with your update. We are working on making the update process more informative.

Update time can vary significantly, depending on the speed of your network, the speed of your SD card (or other storage medium), and your device performance.

If your {{ $names.os.lower }} update fails for any reason, the device should still be recoverable. For devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.x, the user application should still be running normally, and the reasons for failure can be examined through the update logs at `/mnt/data/balenahup/` (or potentially the legacy location `/mnt/data/resinhup/`). If you have any issues, please contact us on the [troubleshooting section of the forums][troubleshooting].

## Update locks

[Update locks](https://docs.balena.io/learn/deploy/release-strategy/update-locking/) is a mechanism that allows applications to enter critical sections of code and prevent updates that would interrupt the application from running. Update locks can also be used to delay the reboot that applies a hostOS update operation until the application exits the critical section by removing the update locks. HostOS update operations require the use of exclusive locks and will not respect shared locks. [Overriding update locks](https://docs.balena.io/learn/deploy/release-strategy/update-locking/#overriding-the-lock) will ignore existing locks and allow a hostOS update process to proceed with a reboot.

Check out our [update process][update-process] to understand how the process goes through each step.

title: Update process details
excerpt: Details of the {{ $names.os.lower }} self-service update process
---

# What happens during a {{ $names.company.lower }} host OS update?

The ability to remotely update the entire host operating system (OS) of your device, rather than just the user application, is a core feature of {{ $names.company.lower }}. Performing updates may feel like an opaque process, so we thought it would be useful to break it down.

__Note:__ Once a host OS update is successful, it is not possible to roll back to a previous OS version (except via [automatic rollbacks](#automatic-rollbacks) as noted below).

In general, host OS updates are meant to be atomic: if an update is run, it either finishes correctly or it fails and leaves the system in its previous, usable state. If deploying the new root file system is unsuccessful, the boot settings are not switched over to the new partition. This means the device can be rebooted with the previous OS version and no noticeable changes. For failures related to the boot partition, the latest versions of {{ $names.os.lower }} have a rollback feature that will leave the partition in a good state. In the update process, an updater script gets transferred to the device to handle the update process, as described in detail below.

## Upgrading between {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.x versions

The first step the updater script performs includes a number of coherence checks, so that an update does not progress if something isn't right. The checks include, among other things, whether the device is running a {{ $names.os.lower }} version that it can work with (i.e., not on 1.x), whether the script is running on the right device type, and whether it can reach the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} registry to get the target {{ $names.os.lower }} image.

Next, the supervisor is stopped so it does not inadvertently interfere with the update process. The user application is kept running to minimize downtime. The updater then attempts to locate the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} releases associated with the current & target OS versions to use deltas to reduce the over-the-wire size of the update. If a delta is not found or able to be created, the updater uses **{{ $names.engine.lower }}** to pull the new {{ $names.os.lower }} image directly from {{ $names.cloud.lower }}'s registry. Finally, if either the delta application fails or the registry pull fails, the updater falls back to Docker Hub. When the pull succeeds, the spare root partition is formatted and the contents of the image are exported onto that partition. The modifications to the boot partition are also applied. Not all files in the boot partition are updated though and some of them are kept back. These can vary depending on your OS version, but a current list can be found [here](https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/blob/master/meta-balena-common/recipes-support/hostapp-update-hooks/files/1-bootfiles).

The updater script checks to see if the new {{ $names.os.lower }} version ships with a newer supervisor version than what the device currently runs, and, if so, the supervisor is updated.

Finally, the boot settings are modified so that on the next reboot the new root file system is used. As a last step, the device is rebooted.

For devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.x, a status of `OS update failed` means the user application should still be running normally, and the reasons for failure can be examined through the update logs at `/mnt/data/balenahup/` (or potentially the legacy location `/mnt/data/resinhup/`). The device may have some reduced functionality, for instance if the supervisor was stopped for the update, but we are working on ways to automatically restore full functionality whenever possible.

## Automatic rollbacks

Rollbacks is a framework designed to automatically roll back the OS update in case something goes wrong.

There are two rollback mechanisms in the OS, covering different update failure modes. One based on health checks called the `rollback-health`, and the recognizing if the new system is unbootable for some reason, the `rollback-altboot`. Learn more about [rollback mechanisms][rollback-mechanism].

title: Overview

# {{ title }}

The API is the core of the {{ $names.company.lower }} platform. It provides a secure channel for communication between {{ $names.company.lower }} services and the database. The API's HTTP interface not only informs the dashboard and the CLI, it also gives you the power to directly access resources associated with your account. With the API, you can fetch and update information about your fleets, devices, environment variables and more.

This guide is split into two parts. On this page, you will find a basic tutorial to help you construct API calls. The [Resources][resources] page provides more details about the resources that can be queried using the API, including example calls and a list of available fields.

__Warning:__ When using the API to make changes, take great care in selecting the appropriate resources, as there are *no checks* to prevent you from accidentally making widespread, irreversible mistakes. Test filters with a `GET` call *before* you use them in a `PATCH` or `DELETE` request.

## Versioning

When a new version of the API is released, calls to old versions of the API will still work. The API is currently on v7, but v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and v6 calls are translated to the equivalent calls in the newest version.

## Authentication

API requests are authorized using [session tokens][tokens] or [named API keys][api-keys]. To authenticate with either type of authentication token, make sure to include `Authorization: Bearer <auth token>` as a header in your API call.

## Constructing API calls

The {{ $names.company.lower }} API uses the Open Data Protocol ([OData][odata]), which defines a standard set of tools for querying and modifying structured data. To help you get started, we'll go over some of the most common requests, but when you're ready to build more advanced API calls make sure to consult the [OData documentation][odata-docs].

To construct an API call, it helps to understand a little about how the underlying data is structured. The {{ $names.company.lower }} data model consists of a number of connected resources. Resources include devices, fleets, users, and more. When you make an API call, you are asking to either view, create, modify, or remove a resource. The *method* of the API call corresponds to the action you are trying to take:

- **GET:** view information about a resource
- **POST:** create a new resource
- **PATCH:** modify an existing resource
- **DELETE:** remove a resource

Knowing the resource you wish to act upon and the method you wish to act with is enough for some requests. For example, if you want to view all fleets you have access to (which includes public fleets), you can use the `GET` method and the `application` resource. Your API call would look like this:

```shell
curl -X GET "{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/application" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

Depending on the number of fleets you have access to, this could return much more information than you need. There are two query methods that could help you with this: `$select` and `$filter`.

`$select` specifies which fields to return for each resource. By default, every field comes back as part of the response, but most use cases require only one or two of these pieces of information.

The following API call uses `$select` to only return the name, slug and device type id for each application:

```shell
curl -X GET "{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/application?\$select=app_name,slug,is_for__device_type" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

In some cases, you'll want to get information for one specific resource, rather than all resources of that type. If you happen to know the resource ID, you can simply append it to the resource name:

```shell
curl -X GET "{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/device(<ID>)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

This also works for other pieces of unique information as long as you specify them, eg the device uuid for devices:

```shell
curl -X GET "{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/device(uuid='<UUID>')" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

or for resources where multiple elements combine to be unique, eg for device tags the device and tag key are a unique combination:

```shell
curl -X GET "{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/device(device=<DEVICE ID>,tag_key='<KEY>')" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```


Many times, however, you won't know the internal ID or other unique info used by the API, and you'll want to use some other piece of information to find the appropriate resource. In these cases, you can use the `$filter` method to select resources based on any field. For example, if you are looking for a specific device, it may be you have neither the ID nor UUID but you do know the name:

```shell
curl -X GET \
"{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/device?\$filter=name%20eq%20'<DEVICE NAME>'" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

Notice the construction here: `$filter=` is used to define the field, and then the value is specified after the `eq` keyword. This is the most straightforward example—there are many other ways to build filters, which you can find in the OData documentation.

It's also possible to filter on a field that belongs to a linked resource. To find all devices belonging to an application by that application's slug, you would construct your query like this:

```shell
curl -X GET \
"{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/device?\$filter=belongs_to__application/any(a:a/slug%20eq%20'<APP_SLUG>')" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

Similarly it's also possible to find all applications belonging to a specific organization based on that organization's handle, with a query like this:

```shell
curl -X GET \
"{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/application?\$filter=organization/any(o:o/handle%20eq%20'<ORG_HANDLE>')" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

If you want to extend this to return all fleets that are related with the authenticated user across all organizations that it is a member of, you can then use a `$filter` on the `is_directly_accessible_by__user` property. For example:

```shell
curl -X GET "{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/application?\$filter=is_directly_accessible_by__user/any(dau:true)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```


A final tip for constructing API calls: for some of the fields in the API response, a link to another resource is provided rather than the complete information about that resource. For example, if you make a call requesting information about a specific device, the `belongs_to__application` field will return a link to an application, but not all the information about that application. To get all the fields for the application resource, you can use the `$expand` method:

```shell
curl -X GET \
"{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/device(uuid='<UUID>')?\$expand=belongs_to__application" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

Similarly we can extend our earlier API call that retrieves all applications to also include their device type slug by using a `$expand`:
```shell
curl -X GET \
"{{ $links.apiBase }}/v7/application?\$select=app_name,slug&\$expand=is_for__device_type(\$select=id,slug)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>"
```

## Rate limits

We intentionally do not publish detailed rate limits or the inner workings of our rate-limiting algorithm. Our goal is to keep the API experience as seamless as possible. 

Engineers using our API shouldn’t have to manage the complexity of rate limits to automate workflows effectively. The rate limits we enforce are generous, and customers running large-scale automation rarely encounter issues.

Publishing specific rate limits often results in them being treated as a "target" or a fixed barrier, which is not how we intend the API to be used. Our rate limits are designed to provide a minimum level of protection for the API and to ensure consistent performance for all users, without requiring customers to worry about exceeding them.

To maintain the best experience, we also need the flexibility to adapt and evolve the rate-limiting algorithm. Publishing fixed limits could constrain our ability to improve and respond to specific needs without disrupting customers. 

Instead, we provide the `Retry-After` header. The HTTP `Retry-After` response header indicates how long the user agent should wait before making a follow-up request. When a request exceeds the current rate limit, the response will include this header with a value indicating how long you should be waiting before retrying. This ensures your code can dynamically adapt on runtime without needing workarounds or context about the rate-limiting mechanism.

# [Deprecated] balenalib base images

Balenalib was the central home for 26,000+ IoT-focused Docker images built specifically for balenaCloud and balenaOS. Balena ceased publishing updates to balenalib in 2025, however all of the previously published images are still available and still work. 

**They should not be used in any new projects as they will receive no further updates.**

This page provides historical reference to the previously published base images, as well as crucial information for those looking to replicate one of these images using an up-to-date, officially published image. We recommend our [base images documentation](/reference/base-images/balena-base-images/) to choose an alternative base image.

## Supported Architectures, Distros and Languages

Balenalib supported the following OS distributions and language stacks: 
(Refer to the [balena base images](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/balena-base-images) repository to find the Dockerfiles and installer scripts for any of the deprecated balenalib base images.)


{{>"general/base-images"}}

## Features Overview

- [`run`](#run-vs-build) and [`build`](#run-vs-build) variants designed for multistage builds.
- [cross-build](#building-arm-containers-on-x86-machines) functionality for building ARM containers on x86.
- Provide access to [dynamically plugged devices](#working-with-dynamically-plugged-devices) in your container by enabling [`udevd`][udevd-link].  
- Helpful package installer script called `install_packages` inspired by [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb#why-use-minideb).

### How the Image Naming Scheme Worked

In general, the naming scheme for the `balenalib` image set followed the pattern below:


```
balenalib/<hw>-<distro>-<lang_stack>:<lang_ver>-<distro_ver>-(build|run)-<yyyymmdd>
```

#### Image Names

- `<hw>` is either architecture or device type and is **mandatory**. If you are using `Dockerfile.template`, you can replace `<hw>` with `%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%` or `%%BALENA_ARCH%%`. Images named with device type are built using base images named with architecture. The `%%BALENA_MACHINE_NAME%%` base images are bigger and include more tools. 
- `<distro>` is the Linux distribution. There were four distributions, namely Debian, Alpine, Ubuntu and Fedora. **This field was optional and will default to Debian if left out**.
- `<lang_stack>` is the programming language pack, which included Node.js, Python, OpenJDK, .Net, and Go. This field was optional, and if left out, no language pack was installed.


#### Image Tags

In the tags, all of the fields were optional, and if they were left out, they defaulted to their `latest` pointer.

- `<lang_ver>` was the version of the language stack, for example, Node.js 20.12.0, it can also be substituted for `latest`.
- `<distro_ver>` was the version of the Linux distro, for example Debian and its valid version as mentioned above in the list.
- For each combination of distro and stack, there were two variants called `run` and `build`. The build variant was much heavier as it had a number of tools preinstalled to help with building source code. You can see an example of the tools that were included in the Debian variants. Navigate to the Distro version you are looking for and find the `build` and `run` variants of the image. The `run` variants are stripped down and only include a few useful runtime tools. **If no variant is specified, the image defaults to `run`. This is often referred to as slim on official Dockerhub images.**
- The last optional field on tags was the date tag `<yyyymmdd>`. If a date tag is specified, the pinned release will always be pulled from Docker Hub, even if there is a new one available. 



#### Examples

`balenalib/raspberrypi3-node:10.18`

- `<hw>` : raspberrypi3 - The Raspberry Pi 3 device type.
- `<distro>` : omitted, so it defaults to Debian.
- `<lang>` : node - the Node.js runtime and npm will be installed
- `<lang_ver>` : 10.18 - This gives us Node.js version 10.18.x whatever is the latest patch version provided on balenalib
- `<distro_ver>` : omitted, so it defaults to `buster`
- `(build|run)` : omitted, so the image defaults to the slimmed down `run` variant
- `<yyyymmdd>` : omitted, we don't have a date frozen image, so new updates pushed to our 10.18 tag, for example patch versions from Node.js will automatically be inherited when they are available.

`balenalib/i386-ubuntu-python:latest-bionic-build-20191029`

- `<hw>` : i386 - the intel 32 bit architecture that runs on Intel Edison
- `<distro>` : ubuntu
- `<lang>` : python
- `<lang_ver>` : `latest` points to the latest Python 2 version, which currently is 2.7.17
- `<distro_ver>` : bionic is Ubuntu 18.04
- `(build|run)` : `build` - to include things like `build-essential` and `gcc`
- `<yyyymmdd>` : 20191029 is a date frozen image - so this image will never be updated on Docker Hub. 

### run vs. build

For each combination of `<hw>`-`<distro>`-`<lang>` there was both a `run` and a `build` variant. These variants were provided to allow for easier multistage builds.

The `run` variant was designed to be a slim and minimal variant with only runtime essentials packaged into it. To find what packages exactly, navigate to the [Debian version][debian-variants] and check the Dockerfile inside the `run` folder.

The `build` variant was a heavier image that included many of the tools required for building from source such as `build-essential`, `gcc`, etc. As an example, you can see the types of packages installed in the `balenalib/armv7hf-debian:build` variant on the [balena-io-library/base-images][debian-variants] repository.

These variants made building multistage projects easier.
For example, installing an I2C node.js package requires a number of build time dependencies to build the native `i2c` node module. However we don't want to send all of those dependencies down to our device. 


```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/raspberrypi3-debian-node:latest-bookworm-build as build
RUN npm install --only=production i2c

# The run time container that will go to devices
FROM balenalib/raspberrypi3-debian-node:latest-bookworm-run

# Grab our node modules for the build step
COPY --from=build ./node_modules ./node_modules
COPY main.js main.js

CMD ["node", "main.js"]
```

#### Notes

Devices with a [device type](/reference/base-images/devicetypes/) of `raspberry-pi` (Raspberry Pi1 and Zero) were built from `balenalib/rpi-raspbian` and were [Raspbian]({{ $links.githubLibrary }}/resin-rpi-raspbian) base images. The `raspberry-pi2` and `raspberrypi3` device types Debian base images have the Raspbian package source added, and Raspbian userland pre-installed.

Not all OS distro and language stack versions are compatible with each other. Notice that there are some combinations that were not available in the `balenalib` base images.

- [Node.js dropped 32-bit builds](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/885) a while ago so i386-based nodejs images (Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu) v8.x and v6.x are official. New series (v10.x and v12.x) used unofficial builds.
- armv6 binaries were officially dropped from Node.js v12 and v12 armv6 support is now considered unofficial.
- The Node.js v6.x and v8.x series are not available for i386 Alpine Linux base images v3.9 and edge as node crashes with segfault error.

Every balenalib image included a small `install_packages` script that abstracted away the specifics of the underlying package managers, and added the following useful features:

- Install the named packages, skipping prompts etc.
- Clean up the package manager metadata afterward to keep the resulting image small.
- Retries if package install fails. Sometimes a package will fail to download due to a network issue, and retrying may fix this, which is particularly useful in an automated build pipeline.

An example of this in action is as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/raspberrypi3

RUN install_packages wget git

CMD ["bash", "start.sh"]
```

This will run an `apt-get update -qq`, then install `wget` and `git` via apt-get with `-y --no-install-recommends` flags, and it will by default try this 2 times before failing. 

To see the source for `install_packages` navigate to the [Debian version](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/balena-base-images/armv7hf/debian) you want, selecting `run` or `build` folder and click `Dockerfile`


## How the Images Worked at Runtime

Each `balenalib` base image has a default [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) which is defined as `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/entry.sh"]`. This ensures that [entry.sh][entry-sh-link] is run before your code defined in `CMD` of your `Dockerfile`.

On container startup, the [entry.sh][entry-sh-link] script first checks if the `UDEV` flag is set to `true` or `false`. In the case where it is `false`, the `CMD` is then executed. In the case it is `true` (or `1`), the entry.sh will check if the container is running privileged, if it is, it will mount `/dev` to a devtmpfs and then start `udevd`. In the case the container is an unprivileged container, no mount will be performed, and `udevd` will be started (although it won't be very much use without the privilege).

At the end of a container's lifecycle, when a request to container restart, reboot or shutdown is sent to the supervisor, the [balenaEngine](https://www.balena.io/engine/) will send a `SIGTERM` (signal 15) to the containers, and 10 seconds later it will issue a `SIGKILL` if the container is still running. This timeout can also be configured via the [stop_grace_period](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#stop_grace_period) in your docker-compose.yml.

## Working with Dynamically Plugged Devices

To interact with hardware that is plugged in at runtime, such as USB or serial devices, you will want to enable [`udevd`][udevd-link] in your container. In `balenalib` images this was done by either adding `ENV UDEV=1` in your `Dockerfile` or by setting an environment variable using [variables][variables].

This also required you to run your container `privileged`.

When a `balenalib` container runs with `UDEV=1` it will first detect if it is running on a `privileged` container. If it is, it will mount the host OS `/dev` to a devtmpfs and then start [`udevd`][udevd-link]. Now anytime a new device is plugged in, the kernel will notify the container [`udevd`][udevd-link] daemon and the relevant device nodes in the container `/dev` will appear.

__Note:__ Newer balenalib base images made sure `udevd` ran in its own network namespace, so as to not interfere with cellular modems. 


### Balenalib Image Notes

- `UDEV` defaults to off. See [Working with Dynamically Plugged Devices](#working-with-dynamically-plugged-devices).
- The `INITSYSTEM` functionality has been completely removed, so containers that rely on [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) or [openRC](https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc) should install and set up the initsystem in their apps. See [Installing your own Initsystem](https://docs.balena.io/reference/base-images/balena-base-images#installing-your-own-initsystem).
- Mounting of `/dev` to a devtmpfs will only occurs when `UDEV=on` and the container is running as `privileged`. `1`, `true` and `on` are valid value for `UDEV` and will be evaluated as `UDEV=on`, all other values will turn `UDEV` off.

# Choosing a base image

## Where is balenalib?
Balenalib was the home for 26,000+ IoT-focused Docker images built specifically for balenaCloud and balenaOS. Balena stopped publishing updates to balenalib in 2025, however, all of the previously published images are still available. Read [our announcement blog post](https://blog.balena.io/deprecate-balenalib-images/) for more information. 

Note: The docs for balenalib base images (deprecated) that used to be on this page [have been moved here](/reference/base-images/balena-base-images-reference/). 

When balena started publishing these base images back in 2016, the Docker ecosystem was quite new, and support for ARM 6/7/8 images was almost non-existent. Today, however,  Docker images for all architectures and software stacks are  well supported and maintained. Consequently, this shift in the larger ecosystem meant that balenalib base images' value and advantage have diminished over the past few years.


## Use Docker Official Images instead

We now recommend using [Docker Official Images](https://hub.docker.com/search?badges=official). These images hosted on Docker Hub are pre-built, vetted, and curated. They provide clear documentation, receive regular updates, and are continuously monitored for security issues.

The Docker Official Images team, with help from community contributors, formally reviews each Docker image before accepting it into the program. To identify a Docker Official Image, look for this tag below on Docker Hub for the image you are assessing. 

![Docker Official Image](/img/docker_official.png)

## How to Pick a Base Image

For general use cases, you can usually start with a standard Linux distribution’s Official Docker Image, and install further requirements and dependencies in your Dockerfile. For instance, here is an example of installing the Nano text editor in the [official Debian image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian):

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:bookworm-20250407  # This is the official image

# Here we install a utility not included in the base image:

RUN apt update && apt install -y --no-install-recommends nano  

CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
```
Scroll past the tag list to find more helpful information in the “Overview” tab on the Docker Hub repository for these popular OS images. That information includes supported architectures, image descriptions, and the available variants and tags:
 
 - Debian official images: [https://hub.docker.com/_/debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian)
 - Ubuntu official images: [https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)
 - Fedora official images: [https://hub.docker.com/_/fedora](https://hub.docker.com/_/fedora)
 - Alpine official images: [https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)

### Choose the right device architecture

Dockerhub uses a different naming convention for device architecture than balena. Use the table below to convert a balena specified architecture to the equivalent architecture listed on Dockerhub. To see the architecture for balena-supported devices, check out the [balena Machine names and architecture page](/reference/base-images/devicetypes/).

As an example, if you are using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, the balena machine name page shows the “balena_arch” as “aarch64”. In the table below, aarch64 is referred to as  “arm64v8 (ARMv8 64-bit)” on Dockerhub. Look out for arm64v8 images to find images compatible with the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W device type. 


| Docker Architecture | Balena Architecture (BALENA\_ARCH) | Alternative Names | Example Device Types |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| arm32v6 (ARMv6 32-bit) | rpi | armv6, armhf (in some contexts) | Raspberry Pi 1 model B+, Raspberry Pi Zero/W |
| arm32v7 (ARMv7 32-bit) | armv7hf | armv7, armv7l, armhf | BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi 2 |
| arm64v8 (ARMv8 64-bit) | aarch64 | arm64, armv8 | IOT-GATE-iMX8, Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson |
| amd64 (Linux x86-64) | amd64 | x86\_64, x64 | Intel NUC, generic x86-64 devices, cloud VMs |
| i386 (x86/i686) | i386 | x86, i686, ia32 | Older 32-bit x86 based devices |
| windows-amd64 (Windows x86-64) | Not supported | win-amd64, x86\_64 (on Windows) | ? |

### Tags vs. digests

When using base image tags in your Dockerfile, such as `FROM ubuntu:22.04` you are specifying an image name (“ubuntu”) and tag (“22.04”). Whenever you build your container, it will pull the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04, which may change over time as new updates are added. 

We recommend using a fixed (pinned) version of an image in production.  Using a digest will make sure you are consistently pulling the same image for your application. 

For instance, we can see the digests listed for ubuntu 22.04 in Dockerhub:

![Digests](/img/digests.png)

Clicking on the one for linux/arm64/v8, we can copy the full digest by clicking the link:

![Digest link](/img/digest_link.png)

And then we can use that digest instead of the tag to always get the same version of Ubuntu 22.04:

```
FROM ubuntu@sha256:04c0fd7fceedf5c0fe69ec1685c37cf270f03ae424322a58548b095528f4a3c3
```

Note that one downside to this method is that you may not receive some important security updates because your image is “pinned” to that static version. It’s a good idea to periodically test newer versions and update accordingly.

### Distroless images

Official OS images still contain packages and utilities which you may not need. As you narrow in on the dependencies for your production application, you may want to consider a  “distroless image”.

A distroless image is a Docker image that contains only the necessary runtime dependencies for an application, without including unnecessary utilities like package managers, shells, or other items found in a typical Linux distribution. These images can provide a minimized security attack surface, smaller deployment sizes, and faster start-up time, among other benefits.

Distroless images are typically built from scratch or based on minimal distributions like Debian or Alpine, but with all non-essential components removed. Tools such as [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) can assist in such builds.

**Important note:** Distroless images do not include a shell, so you cannot open a session into them for debugging like you can with other images. This makes them ideal for production, but more challenging for development and debugging. Distroless images also breaks the web terminal feature of the balenaCloud dashboard and CLI without any notification or error message since it requires the container to have a shell to SSH into.

Other resources for distroless images include:
[https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)

[https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/distroless.md](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/documentation/distroless.md)

[https://www.docker.com/blog/is-your-container-image-really-distroless/](https://www.docker.com/blog/is-your-container-image-really-distroless/)

## Using Software Language Stacks

To utilize a software language stack such as Python or Node.js in your container,  look for the Official Docker image tag and check out the overview tab to see if one of the variants fulfills your version, size and device architecture requirements. Docker Official images could increase the size of the application and we recommend testing the image thoroughly before using it in your production fleet.

Here’s a list of Docker Official images for popular programming languages:

 - Python: [https://hub.docker.com/_/python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python)
 - Node: [https://hub.docker.com/_/node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)
 - OpenJDK: [https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk)
 - .NET: [https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-sdk](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet-sdk)
 - Rust: [https://hub.docker.com/_/rust](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust)
 - Go: [https://hub.docker.com/_/golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang)

These language stacks are often built on top of only one or two different OS images such as Debian and Alpine. What if you want an image combination that the official image does not provide, such as Python on Ubuntu? In that case you can try installing packages from the OS’s package management system tool, in this case using `apt` to install the language version which ships with the selected distribution, for example:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:focal-20250404  #  This is the official Ubuntu image

# Update the packages and install the Python version provided
#  by Ubuntu's package manager:
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 python3-dev

CMD [“sleep”, “infinity”]
```

In the above example, Ubuntu’s apt will install the default Python version set by package maintainers. The distro may have a few other versions of the software available, or you could look into adding a [Personal Package Archive](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/addremove-ppa.html.en) (PPA). If you want a specific version of Python, (or any package for that matter) you can also install the binaries from the official sources. Similarly for other OS distributions, you need to find which versions are available in the package repositories when installing a particular software, for example, [Alpine Package Repository](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages). 

The instructions for installing a language stack from the official binaries is beyond the scope of this document, but many guides exist online. Here are a few examples:

 - Installing Python from source: [https://realpython.com/installing-python/#linux-how-to-build-python-from-source-code](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#linux-how-to-build-python-from-source-code)
 - Installing Node from source: [https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md)
 - Installing Golang from source: [https://linuxhit.com/how-to-install-go-on-linux-using-official-binary-releases/](https://linuxhit.com/how-to-install-go-on-linux-using-official-binary-releases/)
 - Installing OpenJDK from source: [https://openjdk.org/groups/build/doc/building.html](https://openjdk.org/groups/build/doc/building.html)
And so on

Note that these instructions are not necessarily written for building a container, so you may have to adapt the steps to work in a Dockerfile. For example, if an instruction says to “download a file with wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz” the line in the Dockerfile would be: 
`RUN wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz`

## Installing L4T Library Stacks

For base images that will be running on NVIDIA Jetson devices, you’ll likely want to add NVIDIA’s APT sources to your Dockerfile. This will allow you to install official NVIDIA packages (such as CUDA, Jetpack, etc…) using your distribution’s package manager. The specific repository URL depends on your base image (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian) and the NVIDIA driver version you need. (More information about that [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).)

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Add NVIDIA APT repository

RUN echo "deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/common r36.3 main" >>  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia.list \
	&& echo "deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/t234 r36.3 main" >>  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia.list \
	&& apt-key adv --fetch-key http://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/jetson-ota-public.asc \
	&& mkdir -p /opt/nvidia/l4t-packages/ && touch /opt/nvidia/l4t-packages/.nv-l4t-disable-boot-fw-update-in-preinstall


# Update package list
RUN apt-get update

# install CUDA

# Continue with your application's build instructions
```

Here’s an example for the legacy TX2 and earlier Jetpack versions:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Add NVIDIA APT repository


RUN echo "deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/common r32.7 main" >>  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia.list \
	&& echo "deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/t186 r32.7 main" >>  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia.list \
	&& apt-key adv --fetch-key http://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/jetson-ota-public.asc \
	&& mkdir -p /opt/nvidia/l4t-packages/ && touch /opt/nvidia/l4t-packages/.nv-l4t-disable-boot-fw-update-in-preinstall

# Update package list
RUN apt-get update

# install CUDA


# Continue with your application's build instructions
```

 - [Jetson on balena Dockerfile examples](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/jetson-examples)

## Installing your own Initsystem

We recommend the use of multiple containers rather than the use of an initsystem, particularly systemd, in the container as it tends to cause a myriad of issues, undefined behavior and requires the container to run fully privileged.

However, if your container relies on initsystem features, it is fairly easy to add this functionality to your base image. We have provided some examples for [systemd](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/examples/INITSYSTEM/systemd/systemd.v230) and [openRC](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/examples/INITSYSTEM/openrc). Please note that different systemd versions require different implementations so for Debian Jessie and older, please refer to [this example](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/examples/INITSYSTEM/systemd/systemd) and for Debian Stretch and later, please refer to [this example](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/examples/INITSYSTEM/systemd/systemd.v230).

Generally, for systemd, it just requires installing the systemd package, masking a number of services and defining a new [entry.sh](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/examples/INITSYSTEM/systemd/systemd.v230/entry.sh) and a [balena.service](balena.service). The Dockerfile below demonstrates this:

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:bullseye-20250224

# Install Systemd
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        systemd \
        systemd-sysv \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENV container docker

# We never want these to run in a container
# Feel free to edit the list but this is the one we used
RUN systemctl mask \
    dev-hugepages.mount \
    sys-fs-fuse-connections.mount \
    sys-kernel-config.mount \

    display-manager.service \
    getty@.service \
    systemd-logind.service \
    systemd-remount-fs.service \

    getty.target \
    graphical.target \
    kmod-static-nodes.service

COPY entry.sh /usr/bin/entry.sh
COPY balena.service /etc/systemd/system/balena.service

RUN systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/balena.service

STOPSIGNAL 37
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/entry.sh"]

## Update balenalib base images

While we recommend migrating to Docker Official Images for new projects, we understand that existing applications may need continued support for balenalib base images. If you need to update or customize your existing balenalib base images to minimize disruption during migration, you can use the original Dockerfiles as a starting point.

All Dockerfiles for the base images publicly are available in the [balena-io-library/base-images repository](https://github.com/balena-io-library/base-images/tree/master/balena-base-images). 

This approach allows you to:
- **Maintain existing functionality** while gradually migrating to official images
- **Update dependencies** and security patches as needed
- **Customize the base image** for your specific requirements
- **Reduce disruption** to existing deployments

Before deployment to your fleet, please **test thoroughly** on actual hardware before deploying to production fleets.

title: Device Types and Versioning
excerpt: Explanation of device types and their version scheme
---

## Device Types
A device type in balena describes a [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) or group of SoCs that have the same boot configuration and are capable of booting the same Operating system. When a new device type is created, it is usually because the SoC or configuration is distinctly different from others that exist.

As an example the [Raspberry Pi 1 model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/) and [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) are part of the same device type since they are both `armv6l` architecture SoCs and the boot loader is capable of booting both boards. However, the [Raspberry Pi 3 model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) is by default a `armv7l` CPU and we therefore separate it into a new device type.

In balenaCloud the device type is also used to define what architecture containers are built for. So in the above example, Raspberry Pi Zero deployments are built for the `armv6l` architecture whereas Raspberry Pi 3 fleets will target the `armv7l` architecture, and the Intel NUC device type will target `x86_64` architecture.

### Designations

When looking at all the supported device types in balenaCloud, you will notice that there are a number of different designations. Here we will discuss a few of these designations in more detail.

#### Official
All device types that are not designated with `COMMUNITY` or `PRIVATE` are considered officially supported boards.

Official device types are:
- Run through a full suite of testing on real hardware each time an OS version is released for the device type.
- We endevour to ensure that all the hardware peripherals on the device type are functional and accessible. This includes things like i2c, SPI, audio, etc.
- Continually updated to new versions of the OS, usually within 2 or 3 minor versions of meta-balena master version.
- Official devices are recommended for production deployments.

On some official device types you will see the `(BETA)` designation. This does not mean the OS itself is `beta` level software, but rather that this device type not yet used by enough people or has not been in production for a long enough time. In balenaCloud all official device types start out as `BETA` and when the team decides the device type has enough production usage, it is graduated out of `BETA`.

#### Private
Private device types have exactly the same guarantees and testing process as official device types but they are only visible to specific customers that have paid for this device support. If you are interested in finding out more about private device support email solutions@balena.io .

#### Community
Device types that are marked as `COMMUNITY` are device types that have been contributed by an external community member rather than the balena team. An example of a community device type is the Orange Pi Zero which was contributed into the {{ $links.githubOS }}/balena-allwinner repo.

The community devices types are:
- Maintained by the community member and feature/support requests are handled in the forums or on the device-types github repository.
- The balena team does **not** test and verify each release of the OS, instead we rely on the community members to conduct testing.
- Updated to newer versions as the community drives it, we do not guarantee the device type will keep up with OS versions.
- Community boards can be promoted to an official balena supported board if a customer is interested in sponsoring the device support. If you are interested in sponsoring a community board, email solutions@balena.io .

#### Discontinued
Discontinued device types are those that are no longer actively maintained by the balena team or anyone in the community and will stop showing in the dashboard as options for new fleets and devices. Any already provisioned devices of this type will continue to function, but will no longer receive operating system updates.

A device type will be discontinued if:
- The device manufacturer end support and sale of the device.
- No devices of this type are provisioned on balenaCloud in the last 6 months.
- If it is a community device type and it has not received maintenance in the last 6 months.
- If it is a private device type and the customer has stopped paying for the device to be supported.

## Versioning

The version string for a particular device type is a combination of the [meta-balena]({{ $links.githubOS }}/meta-balena) version and the device specific repo revisions.

* The version of `meta-balena` is in the format of 3 numbers separated by a dot. The patch number can have a `beta` label. e.g. 1.2.3, 1.2.3-beta1, 2.0.0-beta1.
* The version of the specific device type is constructed by appending to the `meta-balena` version a `rev` label. This will have the semantics of a board revision which adapts a specific `meta-balena` version for a targeted board. For example a `meta-balena` 1.2.3 can go through 3 board revisions at the end of which the final version will be 1.2.3+rev3 .
* When updating `meta-balena` version in a specific device type repo, the revision will reset to 1. Ex: 1.2.3+rev4 will be updated to 1.2.4+rev1 .
* Note that the final OS version is NOT based on the semver specification so parsing of such a version needs to be handled in a custom way. If you are interested in how to parse the version scheme, have a look at our balenaOS version parser [balena-semver](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/resin-semver).

title: WiFi adapters and Modems
excerpt: Notes on WiFi adapter and modem compatibility with balenaOS
---

# Wifi Adapters and Modems

Balena's software validation is only doing a [sanity check](https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/tree/1fb02321afaaea4e43e296ae556e628a1dfed530/tests/suites/os/tests/modem) on features that are commonly required by balenaOS. To run these tests, we use a sample modem with the driver provided by the manufacturer and the NetworkManager/ModemManager support. 

Balena cannot guarantee that a specific modem or chipset is reliable and ready for production from our end. End users should run the necessary tests to validate their use case end-to-end and work with the vendor to resolve issues.


### Configuration

Wifi adapters drain a lot of power which unfortunately causes power issues with many 
devices if you try to *hotswap* the adapters (adding a WiFi adapter to your device 
*after* power-on). Be __sure__ you connect your WiFi adapter prior to switching on your 
device to avoid instability.

With some of the modems listed in the [**ModemManager** Supported Devices list][modemmanager-supported-devices] you may find they struggle to connect, this is most likely due to [usb_modeswitch][usb_modeswitch-link] not knowing how to automatically switch the device to modem mode. In these cases you will need to have a look at your modem's data sheet and figure out how to force it to stay in modem mode.


### Notes on Raspberry Pi

If you are powering your USB modem from a Raspberry Pi, it is a good idea to enable the [full 1.2A current][max-current] throughput for the USB ports.


### Notes on Beaglebone Black

Always run the Beaglebone Black from a 5VDC 1A minimum supply when using a Wifi Dongle. You may also need to use an extension cable to move the dongle away from the planes of the PCB, as often times there is too much interference for the wifi dongles to work correctly. Sometimes standoffs will work. We also have had instances where when placed in a metal case, there can be Wifi issues as well. It will also help to use a dongle with a real antenna on it.

Have a look at this list of [wifi dongles][bbb-wifi-list] that are known to be compatible with the Beaglebone Black. We have seen that the [Beaglebone Green][beaglebone-green-link] does not exhibit these wifi issues and has much better wifi stability overall.

# Reduce bandwidth usage

BalenaOS and the device Supervisor make it easy to manage a device remotely with features like  container logs forwarding, hardware metrics reporting, and Cloudlink for on-demand external access. However, these features consume network bandwidth, and typically cellular providers charge by the megabyte. So to reduce bandwidth usage, a trade-off can be made between cost and features using the configuration options below.

To help you understand the costs, we measured data use over a cellular connection for features that require network transfer. **The minimum bandwidth required is approximately 1 MB per month** for balenaOS v2.108.18 and Supervisor v14.4.4 when all of the features in the table below are turned off and API Polling is set to the minimum value of once per day.

You may configure these features from the fleet/device configuration tabs on the dashboard and as configuration variables. Refer to the [Device Configuration docs][device-configuration] and the [Configuration List][configuration-list] for more information. Below the table, we describe our measurement tool so you can repeat the tests. Finally, be sure to read the [Side Effects](#side-effects--warnings) section for the impact of turning off each feature, particularly Cloudlink.

| Feature / Variable Name | Monthly Bandwidth if enabled | Measurement Notes |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| Cloudlink<br>`BALENA_SUPERVISOR_VPN_CONTROL` | 80 MB | No use of Cloudlink, just bandwidth required to maintain the connection  |
| Device Metrics<br>`BALENA_SUPERVISOR_HARDWARE_METRICS` | 72 MB | Measured with minimal application activity |
| API Poll Interval<br>`BALENA_SUPERVISOR_POLL_INTERVAL` |4x/hour: 28 MB<br>1x/day: 1 MB | 4x/hour is default; 1x/day is minimum   |
| NetworkManager connectivity check<br>(no variable; see [`config.json` docs][networking-connectivity]) | 1x/hour: 8 MB | 1x/hour is default |
| Device Logging<br>`BALENA_SUPERVISOR_LOG_CONTROL`| 8 MB | Measured with one short message per hour; depends on application use |
| Cloudlink connectivity check<br>`BALENA_SUPERVISOR_CONNECTIVITY_CHECK` | N/A  | Requires bandwidth only under error conditions |


## Setup and Rationale

These measurements were made with a Quectel modem on a SixFab HAT on a Raspberry Pi4, and used a Twilio North American SIM. Refer to this [blog post](https://www.balena.io/blog/cellular-iot-isnt-as-hard-as-you-think/) for a similar setup to reproduce results. The device was running balenaOS v2.108.18 and Supervisor v14.4.4. To keep the results generic, the device ran ***only*** the application that measures bandwidth: [Network Metrics Logger](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/network-metrics-logger). We verified our results against the statistics provided by Twilio on the server side.

Your bandwidth measurements may vary based on hardware, location, or cellular provider, but we expect them to be comparable. Of course, your own app may add to network use. We encourage you to measure with your own device and workload! We recommend deploying the [Network Metrics Logger](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/network-metrics-logger) to test your setup.

The Network Metrics Logger is a generic, client-side tool to measure bandwidth. It uses the [NodeJS system information](https://systeminformation.io/) package, which in turn reads network statistics from `/sys/class/net/{iface}/statistics`. Twilio provides an ideal interface for their server-side statistics, but we wanted a tool that works across providers.


## Side Effects / Warnings

**Cloudlink:** Allows the device to be notified instantly of state changes. Turning off Cloudlink disables [certain functionality](/learn/welcome/security/#cloudlink). Also, updates to configuration, environment variables, and other states are not picked up by the device immediately; instead, they are delayed until the next time the device polls the API.

You can re-enable Cloudlink via the dashboard after turning it off. The device will re-establish the link the next time it polls the API, as defined by the poll interval.

**[Device metrics:][device-metrics]** Defines whether metrics such as CPU temperature and memory usage are reported to the API and displayed on the summary page of the device dashboard. If turned off, the metrics panel on the dashboard is hidden since the data has not been reported.

**API Poll Interval:** Defines the time interval between device checks for updates to the fleet, for example, new code pushes, environment variables changes or Cloudlink control changes for the device. If Cloudlink is disabled, lengthening this interval increases the latency of propagating these updates to the device.

**NetworkManager connectivity check:** When enabled for devices with multiple network interfaces, instructs NetworkManager to use routing metrics to avoid using an interface that fails the check. This adaptability is crucial to retain connectivity. However, for a single network interface, NetworkManager can provide only interface status from the check via DBus.

**Device Logging:** When disabled, any logs written by your application or components of balenaOS are not sent to the dashboard.

**Cloudlink connectivity check:** Defines the device's ability to test and indicate (via an LED when available) that it has connectivity issues.

# Device Metrics

The {{ $names.company.lower }} Supervisor reports metrics about your device to the cloud. These metrics are available on your balenaCloud dashboard, on the device summary page:

![Device Metrics](https://assets.balena.io/blog-common/archive/2020/09/device-metrics-1.png)

You can also fetch device metrics data through {{ $names.company.lower }}'s [open API][api], [Node SDK][node-sdk], and [Python SDK][python-sdk]. This allows you to port metrics data to a custom dashboard in order to monitor the utilization and health of your fleet. Note that device metrics are available with {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.56.0+rev1 and higher, running Supervisor v11.14.0 and higher.

The following table has descriptions for each metric reported by the {{ $names.company.lower }} Supervisor:

| Name                    | Type         | Description | API Slug | Optional? |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| CPU utilization         | integer (%)  | Utilization percentage of the CPU. Receive updates when the "bucket" of the CPU usage changes past certain milestones in increments of 20%. | `cpu_usage` | Y |
| CPU temperature         | integer (°C) | CPU temperature in degrees Centigrade in boundaries of 3 degrees, subject to bandwidth saving transfer strategies. | `cpu_temp` | Y |
| Memory usage/total      | integer (Mb) | RAM usage on the device in megabytes. | `memory_usage` / `memory_total` | Y |
| Disk storage used/total | integer (Mb) | Utilized storage and total storage in megabytes. | `storage_usage` / `storage_total` | Y |
| CPU ID                  | string       | CPU serial number provided by manufacturer. | `cpu_id` | Y |
| Undervoltage            | boolean      | Detect power supply insufficiency. Not supplying enough power most commonly leads to power brownouts or disk corruption. Will *not* toggle back to false after true has been reported until reboot occurs. See the [FAQs][choose-power-supply-unit] for tips on choosing a power supply unit. | `is_undervolted` | N |

## Toggling Metrics Reporting

In the table above, you may have noticed that some metrics are optional while others are not. From the perspective of the Supervisor, hardware metrics reported from the device are divided into two categories: optional system metrics, and non-optional system checks. Starting with Supervisor v12.8.0, you can control whether optional metrics are reported to the cloud to save bandwidth by toggling `BALENA_SUPERVISOR_HARDWARE_METRICS`. When metrics reporting is enabled, metrics are reported as part of device state at most every 10 seconds when metrics changes have occurred. When metrics reporting is disabled, optional metrics are not reported, but system checks are still reported. 

__Note__: The `BALENA_SUPERVISOR_HARDWARE_METRICS` configuration variable may be toggled at a fleet or device-specific level from the respective `Configuration` tabs on the dashboard. By default, metrics reporting is enabled.

# Self-service Supervisor Upgrades

The balena Supervisor can be upgraded independently of {{ $names.os.lower }}.

While the best long-term strategy is to consistently [upgrade the host OS](/reference/OS/updates/self-service), there are some cases
whereby an independent Supervisor upgrade is preferable:

* Enable features in the Supervisor not yet available in an OS release
* No reboot
* Less downtime (if any)
* Smaller update size

To run an update for an individual device, navigate to that device's *Settings* tab, scroll down to *Supervisor version* section, and
select the version of the balena Supervisor you would like to update to:

![Supervisor device upgrade](/img/common/updates/supervisor-device-upgrade.webp)

Updates can also be issued to multiple devices in the same fleet with the same CPU architecture. From the device
list, click the checkbox to the left of any online devices you wish to update. Then use the *Modify* dropdown to select the *Supervisor version* option:

![Supervisor batch upgrade](/img/common/updates/supervisor-batch-upgrade.webp)

From the dialog box that opens, select the Supervisor version you would like to update to and click the `Apply` button to trigger the Supervisor update. 

![Supervisor batch upgrade dialog](/img/common/updates/supervisor-batch-upgrade-dialog.webp)

Additionally, these updates can be scheduled for an offline device as well. The update will be performed once the device comes
back online and successfully connects to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} backend.

__Note:__ Only devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0 or greater are able to upgrade the Supervisor independently.

## Upgrade paths

Downgrades of the Supervisor are not supported.

Upgrading to a new minor version is supported, and should be seamless.

Upgrading to a new major version should work; however, it is the user's responsibility to test those changes, and verify that they do not cause problems for their fleet. The changelog for the balena Supervisor can be found [here](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

For devices managed by balenaCloud, we reserve the right to upgrade the Supervisor when necessary, such as to apply bug fixes. (This does not apply to devices managed by balena On Prem installations, or by self-hosted openBalena instances.) We will make every effort to notify users in advance of such an update, and to respect constraints such as bandwidth. In addition, we will not upgrade between major versions without consulting with users.

### Build Time only Secret File

To use build secrets, make a subdirectory `.balena` in the root of your repository. Inside that directory, make another
directory named `secrets` and a file named `balena.yml`. Without any secrets, your tree should look like:

```shell
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .balena
│   ├── balena.yml
│   └── secrets
├── service1
│   └── Dockerfile.template
└── service2
    └── Dockerfile.template
```

To add a secret file, first add the file to the `.balena/secrets` directory:

```shell
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .balena
│   ├── balena.yml
│   └── secrets
│       └── super-secret-recipe
├── service1
│   └── Dockerfile.template
└── service2
    └── Dockerfile.template
```

Now, in the `.balena/balena.yml` file, add the following:

```yaml
build-secrets:
    global:
        - source: super-secret-recipe
          dest: my-recipe
```

This will mount the `super-secret-recipe` file into `/run/secrets/my-recipe` file in every build container. However, the `/run/secrets` folder will not be added to the build context that is sent to the Docker daemon (or balenaEngine),
and therefore:

* The `/run/secrets/` folder will not be present in the image that is deployed to the devices.
* The `COPY` or `ADD` Dockerfile directives will **not** be able to copy files from that folder.
* The folder will be available "for the duration of `RUN` directives", such that secrets can be
  accessed by scripts/code at image build time, for example:

```Dockerfile
RUN cat /run/secrets/my-recipe | secret_processing_script.sh
```

To add a secret file to a specific service's build:

```shell
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .balena
│   ├── balena.yml
│   └── secrets
│       ├── super-secret-recipe
│       └── super-secret-recipe-2
├── service1
│   └── Dockerfile.template
└── service2
    └── Dockerfile.template

4 directories, 6 files
```

and balena.yml:

```yaml
build-secrets:
    global:
        - source: super-secret-recipe
          dest: my-recipe
    services:
        service1:
            - source: super-secret-recipe-2
               dest: my-recipe2
```

This will mount the `super-secret-recipe` file as `/run/secrets/my-recipe` for all services, and `super-secret-recipe-2` as `/run/secrets/my-recipe2` for `service1` only. Again, note that the `/run/secrets` folder is only available during the image build, and not present in the image that is deployed to the devices.

Subdirectories are supported in both the source (`.balena/secrets`) and the destination (`/run/secrets`).

__Note:__ Currently `{{$names.company.lower}} build` and `{{$names.company.lower}} deploy` do not support [build time secret files](#build-time-only-secret-file) out of the box and need to be pointed to a [{{$names.engine.lower}}][engine-link] instance. Refer to the [`{{$names.company.lower}} build`][cli-build-reference] and [`{{$names.company.lower}} deploy`][cli-deploy-reference] command references for additional documentation.

### Build variables

It is also possible to define build variables that will be added to your build from the balena.yml file:

```yaml
build-variables:
    global:
        - MY_VAR_1=This is a variable
        - MY_VAR_2=Also a variable
    services:
        service1:
            - SERVICE1_VAR=This is a service specific variable
```

These variables can then be accessed in your Dockerfile through the ARG instruction. For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM balenalib/armv7hf-debian

ARG MY_VAR_1

RUN echo "The build variable is ${MY_VAR_1}"
```

Build variables should **NOT** be used to hold secrets like access tokens or passwords if the Docker image is accessible to untrusted parties, because the Dockerfile ARG instruction may be stored in the image as the [Docker documentation advises](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg):

__Warning:__ It is not recommended to use build-time variables for passing secrets like github keys, user credentials etc. Build-time variable values are visible to any user of the image with the docker history command.

However, secrets like tokens and passwords can be used in instructions like RUN through the mounted secret files, for example:

```Dockerfile
RUN /bin/cat /run/secrets/my-recipe | command_that_reads_secrets_from_stdin
```

Files under the .balena folders are not saved in the final image, hence being more secure than ARG.

If you are interested in seeing an example of build time secrets and variables see this [project]({{ $links.githubExamples
}}/example-build-secrets-and-variables). Note this is just a toy project and in a real world setting it is not advisable to commit your
`.balena` secrets folder into the git repository. You should always add it to your `.gitignore` file.


--- docs-master/shared/general/container-ssh.md ---

To help you debug, develop, and work with your fleets, we've provided a browser-based terminal and a command line tool for easy SSH access to your devices. With these tools, you have console access to any of your running containers, as well as to the host OS, letting you test out small snippets of code and check system logs on your device. You can also access your device via a standalone SSH client.

__Note:__ Host OS SSH access is available for devices running {{ $names.os.lower }} version 2.7.5 and above.

SSH access is built on [Cloudlink](/learn/welcome/security/#cloudlink) and it not designed for high availability. It is not intended for use in the critical path of your application - you should not depend on it for continuous use as part of your own application.

## Using the dashboard web terminal

To use this feature, navigate to your fleet and select the device you want to access. You will see a *Terminal* window below the *Logs* window:

![SSH Terminal](/img/common/device/terminal.webp)

If your device is online, select a target as either the host OS or a running service, and click the blue *>_ Start Terminal session* button. In order to start a terminal session for a service, you need to ensure that the service container is running. If the container code crashes or ends quickly, it is not possible to attach a console to it.

A terminal session should be initiated for you in a second or two. If you would like a bigger window for the terminal, you can click the *Expand* button in the upper-right corner.

__Note:__ To copy and paste in the terminal window, you cannot use the normal Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V shortcuts. You can either select Copy and Paste from a menu, or use Ctrl + Insert for copy and Shift + Insert for Paste. For MacOS users, ⌘ + C and ⌘ + V work as expected.

## Using `{{ $names.company.short }} device ssh` from the CLI

To use the CLI, first [install it][cli-install] and [add an SSH key to {{ $names.cloud.lower }}][add-ssh-key]. Then run the following command on your development machine's terminal:

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.short }} device ssh <device-uuid>
```

`<device-uuid>` is the unique identifier for the device you want to access, which can be found via the dashboard or in the output of the `{{ $names.company.short }} device list` CLI command. By default, SSH access is routed into the host OS shell. However, you can SSH into a service by specifying its name as part of the command:

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.short }} device ssh <device-uuid> main
```

This also works in multicontainer fleets; simply pass the name of the appropriate service (as defined in docker-compose.yml) instead of `main`.

__Note:__ To run a command in a non-interactive way, you can pipe commands to the CLI's stdin. For example, `echo "uptime; exit;" | balena device ssh <device-uuid>`.

When a fleet name or device UUID is used as above, `{{ $names.company.short }}` ssh uses Cloudlink to create a secure tunnel to the device and then forward SSH traffic between the device and your development machine.

If an IP address or a .local hostname is used (instead of a fleet name or device UUID), `{{ $names.company.short }}` ssh establishes a direct connection that does not rely on Cloudlink:

```shell
$ balena device ssh 192.168.1.23
$ balena device ssh <device-uuid>.local
```

When used with a [production variant of {{ $names.os.lower }}][development-image], this
feature requires balena CLI v13.3.0 or later, and balenaOS v2.44.0 or later. Otherwise, an
SSH key must be added to the device's `config.json` file, [sshKeys
section][config-json-ssh]. These restrictions do not apply to [development variants of {{
$names.os.lower }}][development-image], which allow unauthenticated `root` access (and for
this reason, should never be directly exposed to the public internet).

## Using a standalone SSH client

The SSH server of a {{ $names.os.lower }} device (host OS) listens on TCP port `22222`, and
access is also possible with a standalone ssh client:

```shell
$ ssh -p 22222 <username>@<device_ip_address>
```

When the username is `root`, [production variants of {{ $names.os.lower }}][development-image]
perform authentication against public SSH keys previously added to the device's `config.json`
file, [sshKeys section][config-json-ssh]. When the username matches a valid
{{$names.cloud.lower}} user account, authentication is also performed against that user's
public SSH keys [stored in {{$names.cloud.lower}}][add-ssh-key]
(this feature requires balenaOS v2.44.0 or later). The username can be found in
the profile or preferences section of the web dashboard, or with the `{{$names.company.short}}
whoami` CLI command.

Development variants of {{ $names.os.lower }} allow unauthenticated access and should never be
directly exposed to the public internet.

The IP address will typically be a private IP address of a local network. For remote devices,
see [{{ $names.company.short }} device tunnel][balena-tunnel].

## {{ $names.company.short }} device tunnel

The SSH server of a {{ $names.os.lower }} device (host OS) listens on TCP port `22222`.
This port is not blocked by any firewall on the device itself, but external firewalls or NAT
routers will often block access at the network level. To get around this, you can use the
`{{$names.company.short }} device tunnel` command of the {{ $names.cli.lower }}, which tunnels a
TCP connection between a localhost port and a port on the device. For example, the following
command maps local port `4321` to remote port `22222` on the device:

```shell
$ balena device tunnel <device-uuid> -p 22222:4321
```

The device can then be accessed on local port `4321` with a standalone SSH client:

```shell
$ ssh -p 4321 <username>@127.0.0.1
```

See note in the [previous section](#using-a-standalone-ssh-client) regarding the username
(`root` _vs._ {{$names.cloud.lower}} user account).

## Add an SSH key to {{ $names.cloud.lower }}

To add an SSH key, go to the _Preferences_ page of {{ $names.cloud.lower }} and select the _SSH Keys_ tab.

![SSH key preferences](/img/common/main_dashboard/eekVBTI.webp)

You may either import an existing SSH key from GitHub or manually enter the public SSH key of an existing SSH key on your development machine.

If you do not have an existing key, you can follow [GitHub's documentation][github-ssh], skipping the step about adding the key to your GitHub account, and instead adding the key to your {{ $names.cloud.lower }} account.


--- docs-master/shared/general/country-firewall.md ---

Deploying devices in heavily restricted networks, such as behind country-level firewalls, may affect the ability of the device to connect to cloudlink and is not guaranteed to work.


--- docs-master/shared/general/host-ssh.md ---

## Troubleshooting with host OS access

__Note:__ For an in-depth guide to debugging {{ $names.company.lower }} devices see the [device debugging masterclass][debugging-masterclass].

Host OS SSH access gives you a handful of tools that can help you gather more information about potential issues on your device.

__Warning:__ Making changes to running services and network configurations carries the risk of losing access to your device. Before making changes to the host OS of a remote device, it is best to test locally. Changes made to the host OS will not be maintained when the OS is updated, and some changes could break the updating process. When in doubt, [reach out][forums] to us for guidance.

### {{ $names.os.upper }} services

{{ $names.os.upper }} uses **systemd** as its init system, and as such, almost all the fundamental components in {{ $names.os.lower }} run as systemd services. In general, some core services need to execute for a device to come online, connect to Cloudlink, download applications, and then run them:

* `chronyd.service` - Responsible for NTP duties and syncing 'real' network time to the device.
* `dnsmasq.service` - The local DNS service which is used for all host OS lookups.
* `NetworkManager.service` - The underlying Network Manager service, ensuring that configured connections are used for networking.
* `os-config.service` - Retrieves settings and configs from the API endpoint, including certificates, authorized keys, the cloudlink config, etc.
* `openvpn.service` - The VPN service itself, which connects to cloudlink, allowing a device to come online.
* `balena.service` - The [{{ $names.engine.lower }}][balena-engine] service, the modified Docker daemon fork that allows the management and running of service images, containers, volumes, and networking.
* `balena-supervisor.service` - The {{ $names.company.short }} Supervisor service, responsible for the management of releases, including downloading updates for and self-healing (via monitoring), variables (fleet/device), and exposure of these services to fleets via an API endpoint.
* `dbus.service` - The DBus daemon socket which can be used by containers by applying the _io.balena.features.dbus_ [label][labels], which exposes it in-container. This allows you to control several host OS features, including the Network Manager.

Additionally, there are a couple of utility services that, while not required for a barebones operation, are also useful:

* `ModemManager.service` - Deals with non-Ethernet or Wifi devices, such as LTE/GSM modems.
* `avahi-daemon.service` - Used to broadcast the device’s local hostname.

You may see all enabled services on the host OS with the following command:

```shell
$ systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled
```

To check the status of a service, use the `systemctl status <serviceName>` command. The output includes whether the service is currently loaded and active, together with detail about the process, including the latest entries from the journal log. For example, to obtain the status of the OpenVPN service use the following command:

```shell
$ systemctl status openvpn.service
```

### Checking logs

#### journalctl

Information from a variety of services can be found using the **journalctl** utility. The output from **journalctl** can be very large, and you can filter the output using the `--unit` (or the short version `-u`) option to only output logs from a single service.

A typical example of using **journalctl** might be following a service to see what’s occurring in real-time by using the `--follow` (`-f`) option. For example, to follow the latest supervisor logs on the device:

```shell
$ journalctl --follow --unit balena-supervisor
```

To limit the output to the last *x* messages, use the `-n` option. The following example lists the last 10 messages from the `chronyd` service:

```shell
$ journalctl -n 10 -u chronyd
```

The `--all` (`-a`) option may be used to show all entries, even if long or with unprintable characters. This is especially useful for displaying the service container logs from applications when applied to `{{ $names.company.short }}.service`.

```shell
$ journalctl --all -n 100 -u {{ $names.company.short }}
```

#### dmesg

For displaying messages from the kernel, you can use **dmesg**. Similar to **journalctl**, the output from **dmesg** will be very large without additional options. The following example limits the output to the last 100 lines:

```shell
$ dmesg | tail -n 100
```

### Monitor {{ $names.engine.lower }}

beginning with version 2.9.0, {{ $names.os.lower }} includes the lightweight container engine **[{{ $names.engine.lower }}][engine-link]** to manage **Docker** containers. If you think the supervisor or application container may be having problems, you’ll want to use `balena` for debugging.

From the host OS this command will show the status of all containers:

```shell
$ {{ $names.company.short }} ps -a
```

You can also check the **journalctl** logs for messages related to the {{ $names.engine.lower }} service:

```shell
$ journalctl --follow -n 100 -u {{ $names.company.short }}
```

__Note:__ For devices with {{ $names.os.lower }} versions earlier than 2.9.0, you can replace `{{ $names.company.short }}` in these commands with `docker`.

### Inspect network settings

#### NetworkManager

**NetworkManager** includes a [CLI][nmcli] that can be useful for debugging your ethernet and WiFi connections. The `nmcli` command, on its own, will show all interfaces and the connections they have. `nmcli c` provides a connection summary, showing all known connection files with the connected ones highlighted. `nmcli d` displays all network interfaces (devices).

Another useful place to look for **NetworkManager** information is in the **journalctl** logs:

```shell
$ journalctl -f -n 100 -u NetworkManager
```

#### ModemManager

Similar to **NetworkManager**, **ModemManager** includes a [CLI][mmcli], `mmcli`, to manage cellular connections. `mmcli -L` provides a list of available modems.

### Look up version information

Knowing what version of a specific service is being run on your device can help you troubleshoot compatibility issues, known bugs, and supported features. Many services provide a direct option for displaying their version:

```shell
$ udevadm --version
$ systemctl --version
$ openssl version
```

### Understand the file system

In some cases, you may need to examine the contents of certain directories or files directly. One location that is useful for troubleshooting purposes is the `/data` directory, which contains your device's Docker images, [persistent data][persistent-storage], and host OS update logs. The `boot` directory includes configuration files, such as [config.json][config-json], [config.txt][config-txt] and [**NetworkManager** connections][network].

Note that the [filesystem layout][filesystem] may look slightly different from what you’d expect—for example, the two locations mentioned above are found at `/mnt/data` and `/mnt/boot` respectively.

--- docs-master/shared/general/persistent-storage.md ---

If you have data or configurations that you would like to persist through application and host OS updates, you have the option to keep them in persistent storage. Persistent storage is a good place to write system logs and other application data that should remain untouched even as your code changes.

#### Before {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0

On devices running OS versions before 2.12.0, the `/data` folder in the container is automatically linked to a directory on the host OS and guaranteed to persist across updates. The contents of the `/data` folder can be accessed via the host OS at `/mnt/data/resin-data/<APP ID>`.

The `/data` folder is not synced between devices in your fleet. In addition, the folder is unique to a specific fleet, so if you transfer your device to a new fleet the `/data` folder from the previous fleet will not be accessible in the container. It will, however, still be available via the host OS and if the device is moved back to the original fleet.

Note that the `/data` folder is **not** mounted when your project is building on our build servers, so you can't access it from your `Dockerfile`. The `/data` volume only exists when the container is running on the deployed devices.

#### {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0 and above

Beginning with {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.12.0, persistent storage is handled through [named volumes][multicontainer]. The behavior is much the same as persistent storage on older host OS versions. In fact, for single-container fleets, the default `docker-compose.yml` sets up a `resin-data` named volume that links to a `/data` directory in the container. The only difference between this and earlier versions is that accessing this data via the host OS is done at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/<APP ID>_resin-data/_data`, rather than the `/mnt/data/resin-data/<APP ID>` location used with earlier host OS versions.

Named volumes can be given arbitrary names and can be linked to a directory in one or more containers. As long as every release includes a `docker-compose.yml` and the volume name does not change, the data in the volume will persist between updates.

When using named volumes, note that:

- If a device is moved to a new fleet, the old `/data` folder will be automatically purged.
- During the build process, data added to a container directory that is configured to link to a named volume will be copied to the volume the first time it's created on the device.

#### Using a Supervisor with a version >= v10.0.0

Since balena-supervisor v10.0.0, volumes are no longer automatically removed from disk when references to them are removed from a fleet's `docker-compose` file. This means that it's no longer possible for data to be lost due to the accidental rename of a volume.

If you change volume names regularly, your device will now continue to retain all previous volumes including their contents. To avoid this the supervisor API now provides an [endpoint to cleanup unreferenced volumes](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/supervisor/supervisor-api/#cleanup-volumes-with-no-references). Additionally, it is possible to perform this action from the dashboard via the `Purge Data` action, found on the `Actions` tab for a device.

**Note:** volumes will continue to be removed automatically when moving a device between fleets.

#### Transfer large files

If you have large files you would like your containers to have access to, you can transfer them from your computer directly to your device's SD card. First insert the SD card in your computer and find the `resin-data` partition. Then look for the folder associated with your application, which will either be at `/resin-data/<APP ID>` or `/docker/volumes/<APP ID>_<VOLUME NAME>/_<CONTAINER DIRECTORY>`, depending on your host OS version. Note that these directories will only exist after your application has been started at least once.

#### Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin Devkit 64GB

![Jetson AGX Orin Devkit](/img/jetson-orin/AGX_Orin_perspective_2.webp)

The Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin 64 GB development kit has a label on the inside bottom as shown. It mentions part number 945-13730-0050-000 and reads “Jetson AGX Orin 64GB Developer Kit”.

![AGX Orin Devkit 64GB wide shot](/img/jetson-orin/AGX-Orin-64-wide.webp)

![AGX Orin Devkit 64GB close up](/img/jetson-orin/orin-64GB-close.webp)

This device exposes a debug UART interface over the microUSB port. From Linux machines, the serial connection can be accessed using <code>minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0</code>. It also offers one Display Port for video output.

The default internal storage used for provisioning balenaOS is the AGX Orin 64GB's on-board eMMC. If instead you would like to use an NVMe drive as main storage, please consult the OS installer [target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration option or the [alternative provisioning options](#alternative-provisioning-options) section.

## Checking your Jetson Orin's UEFI firmware version

You can check which UEFI firmware version your Jetson Orin device is running either by connecting to your device's debug UART interface, or by attaching a display to the Orin's video port.

<details>
<summary><b>I want to use the debug UART interface</b></summary>
<br>
<p>The debug UART interface of the Jetson AGX Orin 64GB Devkit is available through the micro-USB interface, when the device is powered on. Connect the other end of the micro-usb cable to your host/development PC. If your host is running Linux, the serial connection to the Jetson device can be accessed using <code>minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0</code>.</p>

![AGX Orin microUSB debug port](/img/jetson-orin/AGX_Orin_DP_microUSB_square.webp)

<p>If you are using the UART interface, the UEFI firmware version will be printed in the boot sequence logs:</p>

![Orin UEFI uart logs](/img/jetson-orin/jetson_orin_uefi_version_uart_logs.webp)

<p>Alternatively, if booting is stopped in the UEFI menu by pressing <code>Esc</code>, the firmware version will be printed in the top-left corner:</p>

## Post-provisioning UEFI firmware update

Once your device has been provisioned with balenaOS and powered back-on, it will attempt to update the UEFI firmware automatically.
The status of the UEFI firmware update process is depicted by a progress bar on the debug UART interface, as well on the display, if connected.

__Note:__ Please do not interrupt the UEFI firmware process by resetting or cutting power to the device.

If you are using the debug UART, the firmware update process will be displayed by a progress bar similar to the one below:

![Orin UEFI firmware update progress](/img/jetson-orin/post_provisioning_uefi_firmware_update.webp)

If a display is connected to the device, the firmware update process will also be rendered on the screen:

![Orin UEFI firmware update progress](/img/jetson-orin/jetson_orin_uefi_firmware_update.webp)

## Alternative provisioning options

By default, most Jetson Orin devices need an internal storage media and a USB flash drive in order to be provisioned. The AGX Orin 64GB Devkit has a built-in eMMC which is used by default for provisioning balenaOS.

  - If you would like to use a USB flash drive to flash an NVME drive attached to your Jetson AGX Orin 64GB instead of the on-board eMMC, use the [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration option in the flasher USB drive's [config.json][config_json] to specify the NVME as target medium:

  ```json
  "installer": {
      "target_devices":"nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  - If you would like the same USB flash drive or NVMe on which the balenaOS flasher image has been written to be used as both install and boot media, use both the [installer.migrate][installer.migrate] and [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration options:
  ```json
  "installer": {
      "migrate": {
        "force": true
      },
      "target_devices":"sda nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  The first medium found in the `target_devices` list will be used for provisioning and it will become the main storage of your device once flashing is complete.

  Available target devices are:
    - <code>mmcblk0</code> - on-board eMMC. Unless overriden, this is the default for the AGX Orin Devkit 64GB
    - <code>sda</code> - removable drives like USB flash drives or SSDs
    - <code>nvme0n1</code> - NVMe drive

  <details>
  <summary><b>How do I set this configuration in my balenaOS image?</b></summary>

  1) Make sure you have <a href="https://jqlang.org/download/">jq</a> and the <a href="https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/latest/">balena CLI</a> installed on your host/development PC. You can obtain it from <a href="https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md">here</a>.

  2) Download the balenaOS image from the balenaCloud dashboard or use the balena CLI to obtain one:

  ```shell
  balena os download jetson-agx-orin-devkit-64gb -o balena.img
  ```

  3) Download a configuration file from your balenaCloud dashboard or generate a new one using the balena CLI:

  ```shell
  balena config generate --fleet balena_cloud_org/balena_cloud_fleet --version 6.4.0 --network ethernet --appUpdatePollInterval 10 --output config.json
  ```
  Replace <code>balena_cloud_org</code> and <code>balena_cloud_fleet</code> with your actual balena cloud organization and fleet.

  4) Depending on your desired provisioning setup, set one or more of the available installer options:

  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.migrate.force |= true' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```

  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.target_devices |= "sda nvme0n1"' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```

  5) Use the balena CLI to inject the modified configuration file in the newly downloaded image:
  ```shell
  sudo balena config inject config.json -d balena.img
  ```

  6) Write the balenaOS image (balena.img) to your USB flash drive or NVMe. We recommend using <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher</a>.

  7) If your AGX Orin is powered on, press the power button and wait for the device to turn off.

  8) Insert the freshly flashed USB flash drive or NVMe drive into the Jetson AGX Orin Devkit and press the power button.

  9) Once provisioning is complete, the board will perform one of the following actions:
    - restart and boot balenaOS automatically, if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has been set in [config.json][config_json].
    - shut down if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has not been set in [config.json][config_json]. Unplug the flasher USB flash drive before powering the AGX Orin Devkit back on.

  10) Your device should appear in your application dashboard within a few minutes.

#### Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano 8GB Production module

![Orin Nano wide shot](/img/jetson-orin/Orin_Nano_Devkit.webp)

The Orin Nano production module has the part number 900-13767-0030-000, which can be observed on the bottom. The main difference from the Orin Nano SD - 900-13767-0050-000 - is that it does not have an SD card slot. This module can be used with a Jetson Orin Nano Devkit carrier board, along with the balenaOS image for the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB (SD) Devkit, provided that the corresponding kernel device-tree is configured in your balena-cloud device configuration page.

![Orin Nano 8GB](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_8GB_Production_SOM_900-13767-0030-000.webp)

![Orin Nano 8GB SOM](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_8GB_Production_SOM_900-13767-0030-000_closeup.webp)

When this module is used with the carrier board provided by the Orin Nano Devkit, a debug interface is available on the UART TXD, UART RXD and GND pins, which are located underneath the Orin module. Additionally, a monitor can be connected to the board's Display Port.

The default internal storage used for provisioning balenaOS on the Orin Nano Production module is an NVMe drive, which needs to be attached to the carrier board prior to booting via a USB flash drive containing the balenaOS flasher image. If instead you would like to use other media, like for example an SSD as main storage, please consult the OS installer [target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration option or the [alternative provisioning options](#alternative-provisioning-options) section.

By default, most Jetson Orin devices need an internal storage media and a USB flash drive in order to be provisioned. When using the Jetson Orin Nano Devkit with a Jetson Orin Nano 8GB production module, an NVMe drive has to be attached to the
carrier board before starting the provisioning process.

  - If you would like to use a USB flash drive to flash an NVMe drive attached to your Jetson Orin Nano, simply insert the USB flash drive into your device and connect power to the board.

  - If you would like the same SD-Card, USB flash drive or NVMe on which the balenaOS flasher image has been written to be used as both install and boot media, use both the [installer.migrate][installer.migrate] and [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration options:

  ```json
  "installer": {
      "migrate": {
        "force": true
      },
      "target_devices":"mmcblk0 sda nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  The first medium found in the `target_devices` list will be used for provisioning and it will become the main storage of your device once flashing is complete.

  Available target devices are:
    - <code>mmcblk0</code> - SD-CARD
    - <code>sda</code> - removable drives like USB flash drives or SSDs
    - <code>nvme0n1</code> - NVMe drive. Unless overriden, this is the default for the Jetson Orin Nano Devkit

  <details>
  <summary><b>How do I set this configuration in my balenaOS image?</b></summary>

  1) Make sure you have <a href="https://jqlang.org/download/">jq</a> and the <a href="https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/latest/">balena CLI</a> installed on your host/development PC. You can obtain it from <a href="https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md">here</a>.

  2) Download the balenaOS image from the balenaCloud dashboard or use the balena CLI to obtain one:

  ```shell
  balena os download jetson-orin-nano-devkit-nvme -o balena.img
  ```

  3) Download a configuration file from your balenaCloud dashboard or generate a new one using the balena CLI:

  ```shell
  balena config generate --fleet balena_cloud_org/balena_cloud_fleet --version 6.4.0 --network ethernet --appUpdatePollInterval 10 --output config.json
  ```
  Replace <code>balena_cloud_org</code> and <code>balena_cloud_fleet</code> with your actual balena cloud organization and fleet.

  4) Depending your desired provisioning setup, set one or more of the available installer options:

  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.migrate.force |= true' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```

  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.target_devices |= "mmcblk0 sda nvme0n1"' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```

  5) Use the balena CLI to inject the modified configuration file in the newly downloaded image:
  ```shell
  sudo balena config inject config.json -d balena.img
  ```

  6) Write the balenaOS image (balena.img) to your SD-CARD, USB flash drive or NVMe. We recommend using <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher</a>.

  7) Ensure the power cable is disconnected from the Orin Nano Devkit.

  8) Insert the freshly flashed SD-CARD, USB flash drive or NVMe drive into the Devkit and connect its power cable.

  9) Once provisioning is complete, the board will perform one of the following actions:
     - restart and boot balenaOS automatically, if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has been set in [config.json][config_json].
     - shut down if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has not been set in [config.json][config_json]. Unplug the external flasher medium and then remove and re-connect the power cable to the Devkit.

  10) Your device should appear in your application dashboard within a few minutes.

#### Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano 8GB (SD) Devkit NVMe

![Orin Nano 8GB  wide shot](/img/jetson-orin/Orin_Nano_Devkit.webp)

The Orin Nano 8GB SD module has the part number 900-13767-0050-000. This number may not be printed on some modules, however, the part can be distinguished by having an SD-CARD slot.

![Orin Nano 8GB SD card slot](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_SD_in_Devkit.webp)

![Orin Nano 8GB SOM card slot](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_8GB_Devkit_SOM_900-13767-0050-000.webp)

The carrier board exposes a debug interface on the UART TXD, UART RXD and GND pins, which are located underneath the Orin module. Additionally, a monitor can be connected to the board's Display Port.

The default internal storage used for provisioning balenaOS on the Orin Nano 8GB (SD) Devkit is an NVMe drive, which needs to be attached to the carrier board prior to booting the flasher USB key. If instead you would like to use other media, like for example an SD card as main storage, please consult the OS installer [target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration option or the [alternative provisioning options](#alternative-provisioning-options) section.

## Checking your Jetson Orin's UEFI firmware version

You can check which UEFI firmware version your Jetson Orin device is running either by connecting to your device's debug UART interface, or by attaching a display to the Orin's video port.

<details>
<summary><b>I want to use the debug UART interface</b></summary>
<br>
<p>For this step you will need a USB to TTL converter cable. The USB to TTL converter's pins need to be connected to the UART TXD, UART RXD and GND pins on the Jetson carrier board, which are located underneath the Orin module. The other end of the cable should be plugged into the USB port of your host/development PC. Your host PC can connect to the Jetson device using a serial communication program like <code>minicom</code></p>

![Orin Nano Devkit pinout location](/img/jetson-orin/Nano_pinout_with_module_square.webp)

![J4012 Case](/img/jetson-orin/J4012_case.webp)

The SOM in the Seeed reComputer J4012 is a Jetson Orin NX 16GB, which has the part number 900-13767-0000-000. The J401 carrier board exposes a debug interface on the UART TXD, UART RXD and GND pins, which are located underneath the Orin NX SOM. Additionally, a monitor can be connected to the board's HDMI Port.

The default internal storage used for provisioning balenaOS on the Seeed reComputer J4012 Jetson Orin NX 16GB is an NVME drive, which needs to be attached to the carrier board prior to booting via a USB flash drive containing the balenaOS flasher image. If instead you would like to use other media, like for example an SSD as main storage, please consult the OS installer [target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration option or the [alternative provisioning options](#alternative-provisioning-options) section.

## Checking your Jetson Orin's UEFI firmware version

You can check which UEFI firmware version your Jetson Orin device is running either by connecting to your device's debug UART interface, or by attaching a display to the Orin's video port.

<details>
<summary><b>I want to use the debug UART interface</b></summary>
<br>

For this step you will need a USB to TTL converter cable. The USB to TTL converter's pins need to be connected to the UART TXD, UART RXD and GND pins on the Jetson carrier board, which are located underneath the Orin module. The other end of the cable should be plugged into the USB port of your host/development PC. Your host PC can connect to the Jetson device using a serial communication program like <code>minicom</code> </p>

## Post-provisioning UEFI firmware update

Once your device has been provisioned with balenaOS and powered back-on, it will attempt to update the UEFI firmware automatically.
The status of the UEFI firmware update process is depicted by a progress bar on the debug UART interface, as well on the display, if connected.

__Note:__ Please do not interrupt the UEFI firmware process by resetting or cutting power to the device.

If you are using the debug UART, the firmware update process will be displayed by a progress bar similar to the one below:

![Orin UEFI firmware update progress](/img/jetson-orin/post_provisioning_uefi_firmware_update.webp)

If a display is connected to the device, the firmware update process will also be rendered on the screen:

![Orin UEFI firmware update progress](/img/jetson-orin/jetson_orin_uefi_firmware_update.webp)

## Alternative provisioning options

By default, most Jetson Orin devices need an internal storage media and a USB flash drive in order to be provisioned. When using the Seeed reComputer J4012, an NVMe drive has to be attached to the
carrier board before starting the provisioning process.

  - If you would like to use a USB flash drive an NVME drive attached to your device, simply insert the USB flash drive and connect power to the board.

  - If you would like the same USB flash drive or NVMe on which the balenaOS flasher image has been written to be used as both install and boot media, use both the [installer.migrate][installer.migrate] and [installer.target_devices][installer.target_devices] configuration options:

  ```json
  "installer": {
      "migrate": {
        "force": true
      },
      "target_devices":"sda nvme0n1"
  }
  ```

  The first medium found in the `target_devices` list will be used and it will become the main storage of your device once flashing is complete.

  Available target devices are:
    - <code>sda</code> - removable drives like USB flash drives or SSDs
    - <code>nvme0n1</code> - NVMe drive. Unless overriden, this option is the default for your device

  <details>
  <summary><b>How do I set this configuration in my balenaOS image?</b></summary>

  1) Make sure you have <a href="https://jqlang.org/download/">jq</a> and the <a href="https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/latest/">balena CLI</a> installed on your host/development PC. You can obtain it from <a href="https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md">here</a>.

  2) Download the balenaOS image from the balenaCloud dashboard or use the balena CLI to obtain one.

  ```shell
  balena os download jetson-orin-nx-seeed-j4012 -o balena.img
  ```

  3) Download a configuration file from your balenaCloud dashboard or generate a new one using the balena CLI:

  ```shell
  balena config generate --fleet balena_cloud_org/balena_cloud_fleet --version 6.4.0 --network ethernet --appUpdatePollInterval 10 --output config.json
  ```
  Replace <code>balena_cloud_org</code> and <code>balena_cloud_fleet</code> with your actual balena cloud organization and fleet.

  4) Depending your desired provisioning setup, set one or more of the available installer options:

  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.migrate.force |= true' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```

  ```shell
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  jq '.installer.target_devices |= "sda nvme0n1"' config.json > ${tmp}
  mv ${tmp} config.json
  ```

  5) Use the balena CLI to inject the modified configuration file in the newly downloaded image:
  ```shell
  sudo balena config inject config.json -d balena.img
  ```

  6) Write the balenaOS image (balena.img) to your USB flash drive or NVMe. We recommend using <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher</a>.

  7) Ensure the power cable is disconnected from your device.

  8) Insert the freshly flashed SD-CARD, USB flash drive or NVMe drive into the carrier board and connect its power cable.

  9) Once provisioning is complete, the board will perform one of the following actions:
     - restart and boot balenaOS automatically, if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has been set in [config.json][config_json].
     - shut down if [installer.migrate.force][installer.migrate] has not been set in [config.json][config_json]. Unplug the external flasher medium and then remove and re-connect the power cable to the carrier board.

  10) Your device should appear in your application dashboard within a few minutes.

### Unable to boot balenaOS image downloaded from balenaCloud

Starting with L4T 32.5, all bootloaders and firmware on the Jetson Nano family of boards have been moved from the sd-card/eMMC to the device's QSPI flash memory. L4T 32.5 and newer bootloaders are not compatible with previous L4T releases.

If you purchased a Jetson Nano SD-CARD Devkit or a Jetson Nano 2GB Devkit that won't boot balenaOS but boots the L4T Ubuntu image, or if you used an L4T 32.5 or newer Ubuntu image with your Jetson Nano and wish to run balenaOS, you can use [Jetson Flash][jetson-flash] to write the balenaOS cloud image on your device. This step is needed only once, for the initial QSPI flashing process, and only if the device does not boot the cloud image directly. You can further switch to newer L4T versions by performing balenaOS updates from the dashboard. You can always see what L4T version the device runs by issuing `uname -a`.

NOTE: On Jetson devices it is important to not interrupt the balenaOS update process. Please ensure the device is powered correctly or has sufficient battery, the internet connectivity is stable and that the device is not rebooted or shutdown during the balenaOS update, otherwise the device may fail to boot and will need to be re-flashed.

## Jetson L4T versions

### How can I determine which L4T a balenaOS image uses?

If the device is running, typing `uname -a` will show the L4T in the kernel version string. Additionally, the L4T version is visible in the [balena-jetson github repository][tegra-binaries-version] for every release tag.

### Custom device tree support

Loading of custom device trees (DT) in balenaOS is supported only by the Jetson Nano and Jetson TX2 family of devices, which have u-boot support. The complete list of devices supporting custom DT and how to apply them is available in the [hardware section][hardware section].

### Unable to boot balenaOS image downloaded from balenaCloud

Starting with L4T 32.5, all bootloaders and firmware on the Jetson Nano family of boards have been moved from the sd-card/eMMC to the device's QSPI flash memory. L4T 32.5 and newer bootloaders are not compatible with previous L4T releases.

If you purchased a Jetson Nano SD-CARD Devkit or a Jetson Nano 2GB Devkit that won't boot balenaOS but boots the L4T Ubuntu image, or if you used an L4T 32.5 or newer Ubuntu image with your Jetson Nano and wish to run balenaOS, you can use [Jetson Flash][jetson-flash] to write the balenaOS cloud image on your device. This step is needed only once, for the initial QSPI flashing process, and only if the device does not boot the cloud image directly.

### Are L4T 28.4 and 28.5 releases supported in balenaOS?

The L4T versions 28.4 and 28.5 did not follow the usual incremental release process, instead these version were released in July 2020 and July 2021 respectively, after the first iterations of L4T 32.X were released.
Since balenaOS uses the [OE4T/meta-tegra][meta-tegra] yocto repository and only updates to incremetal versions of L4T, balenaOS images based on 28.4 and and 28.5 which were released after L4T 32.1 are not available in the balenaCloud.

### Can a balenaOS update from an older L4T 28.X based release to a newer L4T 32.X be interrupted? Can I boot back into the old OS?

Starting with L4T 32.1 the L4T partition layout has changed as well as the firmware and bootloaders stored on the raw partitions. The balenaOS update process thus needs to re-create all the L4T partitions that were modified in the newer L4T, to allow for the newer bootloaders and kernels to run. The L4T 28.x partition layout is not compatible with the L4T 32.x format and vice-versa, which means that a newer kernel cannot boot with the older partition format, nor can an older kernel boot with the new layout and contents. Therefore, the balenaOS update process should not interrupted on the Jetson family of boards, otherwise the device may not boot. Please ensure the device is powered correctly or has sufficient battery, the internet connectivity is stable and that it is not powered-off or rebooted manually during the balenaOS update.

In the case of a device that will not boot because of an interrupted update procedure, it will need to be re-flashed. This can be done by [downloading the L4T Driver Package][l4t-download] (BSP), unpacking it, putting the device in recovery mode and executing `sudo ./flash.sh jetson-tx2 mmcblk0p1`. Once the L4T partitions are finished writing, the device can be booted using the appropriate balenaOS flasher SD-CARD image for the targeted L4T version.

### Custom device tree support

Loading of custom device trees (DT) in balenaOS is supported only by the Jetson Nano and Jetson TX2 family of devices, which have u-boot support. The complete list of devices supporting custom DT and how to apply them is available in the [hardware section][hardware section].

### Unable to flash a board that was previously running L4T 28.x

With {{ $names.os.lower }} 2.47, the [Tegra Linux Driver Package][l4t] (L4T) was upgraded to version 32.2 from a previous version of 28.x. Trying to flash a board that was previously running L4T 28.x with an SD card containing L4T 32.2 or newer will fail. This failure happens because L4T 32.2 and newer kernels are incompatible with the eMMC partitions from L4T 28.x, and vice-versa.

To resolve, either:

* Perform a [self-service update][self-service-update] to update {{ $names.os.lower }} to >=2.47.
* Update the Tegra partitions on the eMMC by [downloading the L4T Driver Package][l4t-download] (BSP), unpack it, put the board in recovery mode and execute `sudo ./flash.sh jetson-tx2 mmcblk0p1`. Once this completes, you can reboot the board with the SD card inserted and flash the board as normal. You only need to perform this process once.

### Are L4T 28.4 and 28.5 releases supported in balenaOS?

The L4T versions 28.4 and 28.5 did not follow the usual incremental release process, instead these version were released in July 2020 and July 2021 respectively, after the first iterations of L4T 32.X were released.

### Device doesn't boot into {{ $names.os.lower }}

you may need to go back into the **BIOS** and make sure the boot order correctly selects to boot from the internal SATA drive and not from USB.

Press the F10 key while the **BIOS** is loading in order to enter the boot menu. Next, select the `UEFI : USB` (or `resinOS`) option from the boot menu so that the device will boot from your USB drive.

### Device boots with the text, "Image Authorization Fail"

You might encounter an error message when the device boots with the text, "Image Authorization Fail". This message appears when Secure Boot is enabled. Follow the steps present in the [Intel support document](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000038401/intel-nuc/intel-nuc-kits.html) to access the BIOS setup screen and disable secure boot. After saving, press the F10 key once again when the NUC reboots to enter the boot menu and select to boot from USB/resinOS.

### My Device Doesn't Boot

To determine the cause of this issue, check your ACT LED for known [error notifications][error]. If no known errors are shown on the ACT LED, attach a screen to your Pi's HDMI port.

One other thing to confirm is that you are not trying to boot a Raspberry Pi 2 with an OS download designed for the Raspberry Pi B+. This will not work. The Raspberry Pi 2 requires an OS download specific to its architecture.

### Connectivity

If a {{ $names.company.upper }} ASCII logo appears with a prompt to check your dashboard, then you are likely experiencing connectivity issues. Check ethernet cables are connected properly and that provided WiFi credentials are correct and try again, also let us known that the LED notification didn't show for you.

### SD Card Corruption

If you are presented with a 'recovery login' prompt this usually indicates an issue with the SD card itself or corruption of data on the SD card, and is likely caused by one of the following:-

* You've copied data onto the card but disconnected it from your computer without properly ejecting it - some data may have not finished being copied yet and thus the card is corrupted - reformat your SD card and copy files over to it and try again.
* The SD card itself is faulty - older SD cards, especially ones which have been used a lot and thus may also be *physically* worn at the pins can be unreliable, resulting in data corruption. Try using a new SD card.


### Error Notifications

#### Unable to Connect to the Internet
If the Raspberry Pi is unable to connect to the {{ $names.company.lower }} servers, the `ACT` LED will flash a repeated pattern of 4 short flashes followed by a pause (`*_*_*_*____*_*_*_*____`).

This is either because it is not connected to the network or because the network ports which {{ $names.company.lower }} relies on are blocked in some way.

* The first things to check in this case is that your device is correctly connected to ethernet or that you correctly entered the wifi credentials. To check wifi credentials, power your device down, remove the SD card, and mount the SD card on your personal computer. If your device is running {{ $names.os.lower }} version 2.0 or greater, wifi credentials are listed in `system-connections/resin-wifi`, found in the `resin-boot` partition of the SD card. Otherwise, check the `config.json` file (in the `resin-boot` partition for versions 1.2 and greater, or `resin-conf` for earlier versions).
* Secondly check that your network is not restricting or blocking the ports specified in the [{{ $names.company.lower }} network requirements](/reference/OS/network/2.x/#network-requirements).
* If you still aren't able to get your device online, reach out to us in the [forums]({{ $names.forums_domain }}).

#### Can't Boot the Kernel.img
If the `ACT` LED blinks with the repeated pattern of 7 quick flashes and a pause (`*_*_*_*_*_*_*____*_*_*_*_*_*_*____`), this means that the Raspberry Pi boot loader is not able to load the correct kernel.img.
* The first thing to check here is that you are using the right OS image for your board type. If you look at the small white print near the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi you should see the type of Raspberry Pi you have. You need to ensure that this is the same as the device type that you selected when creating the fleet on the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard. You can check the type of device for an existing fleet by looking at the 'How to add devices' help text inside the fleet or the icon for that fleet on your dashboard.
* It's important to note that a Raspberry Pi 2 fleet's balenaOS image will not boot on a Raspberry Pi 1 board and vice versa.
* For more in-depth info the boot related LED patterns have a look at the [Raspberry Pi wiki](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Green_LED_blinks_in_a_specific_pattern).

#### Poor Power Supply
If you have a screen attached to your Raspberry Pi and notice that there is a small flashing colorful square in the top right of the screen, it could be the case that your power supply or USB cable is not suitable. Take a look at the [Troubleshooting Power Problems](http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Troubleshooting_power_problems) page on the Raspberry Pi wiki. Additionally, if the onboard `PWR` LED is flashing intermittently, this too could indicate issues with the power supply.

This is either because it is not connected to the network or because the network ports which {{ $names.company.lower }} relies on are blocked in some way.

* The first things to check in this case is that your device is correctly connected to ethernet or that you correctly entered the wifi credentials. To check wifi credentials, power your device down, remove the SD card, and mount the SD card on your personal computer. If your device is running {{ $names.os.lower }} version 2.0 or greater, wifi credentials are listed in `system-connections/resin-wifi`, found in the `resin-boot` partition of the SD card. Otherwise, check the `config.json` file (in the `resin-boot` partition for versions 1.2 and greater, or `resin-conf` for earlier versions).
* Secondly check that your network is not restricting or blocking the ports specified in the [{{ $names.company.lower }} network requirements](/reference/OS/network/2.x/#network-requirements).
* If you still aren't able to get your device online, reach out to us in the [forums]({{ $names.forums_domain }}).

#### Can't Boot the Kernel.img
If the `ACT` LED blinks with the repeated pattern of 7 quick flashes and a pause (`*_*_*_*_*_*_*____*_*_*_*_*_*_*____`), this means that the Raspberry Pi boot loader is not able to load the correct kernel.img.
* The first thing to check here is that you are using the right OS image for your board type. If you look at the small white print near the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi you should see the type of Raspberry Pi you have. You need to ensure that this is the same as the device type that you selected when creating the fleet on the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard. You can check the type of device for an existing fleet by looking at the 'How to add devices' help text inside the fleet or the icon for that fleet on your dashboard.
* It's important to note that a Raspberry Pi 2 fleet's balenaOS image will not boot on a Raspberry Pi 1 board and vice versa.
* For more in-depth info the boot related LED patterns have a look at the [Raspberry Pi wiki](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Green_LED_blinks_in_a_specific_pattern).

#### Poor Power Supply
If you have a screen attached to your Raspberry Pi and notice that there is a small flashing colorful square in the top right of the screen, it could be the case that your power supply or USB cable is not suitable. Take a look at the [Troubleshooting Power Problems](http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Troubleshooting_power_problems) page on the Raspberry Pi wiki. Additionally, if the onboard `PWR` LED is flashing intermittently, this too could indicate issues with the power supply.

### My Device Doesn't Boot

To determine the cause of this issue, check your ACT LED for known [error notifications][error]. If no known errors are shown on the ACT LED, attach a screen to your Pi's HDMI port.

One other thing to confirm is that you are not trying to boot a Raspberry Pi 2 with an OS download designed for the Raspberry Pi B+. This will not work. The Raspberry Pi 2 requires an OS download specific to its architecture.

#### Hardware revision

The inability to boot your Raspberry Pi 3 may be related to the hardware revision used. RaspberryPi 3B+ Rev9 is supported by firmware versions from September 2021 onwards. Thus, balenaOS releases
at v2.95.3+rev1 or newer are expected to work with this hardware revision because they use an updated firmware.

### Connectivity

If a {{ $names.company.upper }} ASCII logo appears with a prompt to check your dashboard, then you are likely experiencing connectivity issues. Check ethernet cables are connected properly and that provided WiFi credentials are correct and try again, also let us known that the LED notification didn't show for you.

### SD Card Corruption

If you are presented with a 'recovery login' prompt this usually indicates an issue with the SD card itself or corruption of data on the SD card, and is likely caused by one of the following:-

* You've copied data onto the card but disconnected it from your computer without properly ejecting it - some data may have not finished being copied yet and thus the card is corrupted - reformat your SD card and copy files over to it and try again.
* The SD card itself is faulty - older SD cards, especially ones which have been used a lot and thus may also be *physically* worn at the pins can be unreliable, resulting in data corruption. Try using a new SD card.

### Wifi connection problems on RPI3

If you are having issues with your RPI3 connecting to your wifi, make sure
to check that the 2.4 GHz channel on your wifi router is set to something less than 11, since
the firmware on the Raspberry Pi doesn't support channel 12 and 13.

### balenaOS boot issues with new hardware revision of RPi4

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) recently released [hardware Rev 1.5](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=329299) of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. This revision of the board requires a relatively recent version of [balenaOS](https://balena.io/os). We recommend using balenaOS v2.88.5+rev1 or later that contains the updated firmware version. BalenaOS v2.75.0+rev1 and earlier versions aren't tested and possibly won't boot on this revision of the board.

To determine if you have hardware Rev 1.5 of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, follow the steps below:

1. Run the following command in balenaOS v2.88.5+rev1 or later. The output should confirm the hardware revision.

```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep Model 
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.5
```

2. Look for the Dialog DA9090 power management controller next to the USB-C port. Check the picture below for reference.

<img src="/img/troubleshooting/DA9090_identified.webp" width="50%">

## Detailed provisioning instructions 

In order to get {{ $names.os.lower }} up and running on your **{{ $device.name }}**, you need to first set it up to boot from your {{ $device.bootMedia }} rather than its
internal [eMMC memory][emmc-link]. To do this, you will need to interrupt the boot process and direct the device to boot from your {{ $device.bootMedia }}.

__Note:__ {{ $names.os.upper }} will completely write over the existing eMMC.

First, make sure the device is setup correctly:
- Ensure you have a HDMI screen attached and powered up.
- Make sure the {{ $device.bootMedia }} is plugged into one of the 4 available USB ports.
- Attach a USB keyboard to one of the other available USB ports.
- Attach a USB WiFi dongle or an ethernet cable to give the device access to the internet.

Now that you have your board setup, apply power to it using the supplied 5 Vdc barrel jack. Tap the `F7` key while the BIOS is loading in order to enter the device's boot menu. If all goes according to plan, you should see the boot menu as pictured below:

<img src="/img/up-board/up-board-uefi-selection.webp" width="60%">

Using the keyboard arrow keys, select the `UEFI : USB` option and hit enter. Your **{{ $device.name }}** will now boot from the {{ $device.bootMedia }} and flash {{ $names.os.lower }} onto the internal [eMMC memory][emmc-link]. If your device is correctly connected to the internet, you should see progress of the flashing on your {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard. Once {{ $names.os.lower }} is safely flashed onto the internal eMMC memory, the device will shut itself down and you should see all the user LEDs on the board switch off.

__Note:__ The blue power LED will stay illuminated even once the device has shutdown. You can find the user LEDs on the underside of the board near the USB ports.

You can now remove the {{ $device.bootMedia }} and power up the board again. Your **{{ $device.name }}** should now be sitting happily waiting on the {{ $names.company.lower }} dashboard. If it still hasn't appeared after 1 or 2 minutes, double check your ethernet connection or that you entered the right WiFi credentials at download time. If you still can't get it online, [contact us on support](/support/).

Now it's time to deploy some code!

### Detailed provisioning instructions 

Currently {{ $names.os.lower }} on the {{ $device.name }} is only capable of booting from SD card, but in the future [eMMC booting will be supported]({{ $links.githubOS }}/resin-imx6ul-var-dart/issues/64). To provision the device, do the following:
1. Verify Switch SW5 is OFF (downwards).
2. Set Boot select switch (SW6) right to boot from microSD Card.
3. Push microSD card into the microSD card slot (J102) of the
VAR-SOLOCustomBoard.
4. Ensure the device has a connection to the internet.
5. Switch ON (upwards) the SW5 switch

While you wait, {{ $names.os.lower }} is partitioning your SD card, installing a custom Linux environment, and establishing a secure connection with our servers.

If you have a class 10 SD card and a fast internet connection your device should appear on the dashboard in a minute or so.

<h1>
  Configuration List for {{ $device.name }}
</h1>
<p>
  The list contains configuration and their respective variables that can be used with {{ $names.company.lower }}
  devices. Some of which will automatically appear for devices with supervisor v7.0.0 and greater. While they may not
  automatically populate in the Configuration dashboard, most of these variables can still be used with older supervisor
  versions, so be sure to check the *Supported by* context for each configuration.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to these values, there may be device-type specific configuration variables that can be set. For example,
  these are a few of the values that apply to Raspberry Pi devices, corresponding to the contents of the <a
    href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html">Raspberry Pi config.txt file</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Wrong configuration may potentially leave a device inaccessible. Be sure to try your changes
  in a controlled environment before applying them to production devices.
</p>

      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Default</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody id="config_table"></tbody>

<p>
  You can find more information on updating config.txt through configuration variables in our <a
    href="/reference/OS/advanced/#modifying-configtxt-using-configuration-variables">Advanced Boot Configuration
    Guide</a>. In addition to the dashboard, this configuration can be also be set using the API or any of its clients,
  including the <a href="/reference/sdk/node-sdk">SDK</a> and <a href="/reference/balena-cli/#envs">CLI</a>.

  If you are using configuration to specify i2c or other interfaces, then check out the docs on how to go about <a
