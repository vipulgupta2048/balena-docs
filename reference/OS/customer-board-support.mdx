# Customer Board Support

We can support your hardware in two ways:

1. **Check for existing support** – See if your board is already listed on our [supported devices list](https://docs.balena.io/reference/hardware/devices/).  
2. **Request custom support** – If you need an alternative to our existing options, explore our [Custom Device Support (CDS) service](https://www.balena.io/pricing#:~:text=Custom%20Device%20Support). This paid service includes a custom balenaOS build for your hardware and ongoing maintenance for a monthly fee.

__Note:__ We do not currently support customers who wish to bring up balenaOS on new hardware themselves.
