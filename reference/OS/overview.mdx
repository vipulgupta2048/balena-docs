## What is balenaOS?

### Introduction

balenaOS is an operating system optimized for running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers on embedded devices, with an emphasis on reliability and developer workflows learned from years of balenaCloud deployments.

The core insight behind balenaOS is that Linux containers offer a practical path to OS-level virtualization on embedded devicesâ€”bringing efficient isolation without the overhead of full VMs.

balenaOS v2 represents decades of embedded experience, now fully open source and extensible for broader device support and modern security best practices.

### Development vs Production mode

balenaOS offers **development** and **production** images.

- **Development mode** unlocks: passwordless SSH (port 22222), exposed Docker socket (port 2375), getty on serial, and **local mode** for rapid iterations. _Do not use in production._
- **Production mode** locks down SSH and Docker, enabling remote access only via Cloudlink (`balena ssh`) or the web terminal. SSH keys must be configured.
