# Host OS Update Process

balenaOS can remotely update its entire host OS via an atomic A/B partition strategy.

1. **Pre-checks**: verify device type, version compatibility, and registry reachability.
2. **Stop supervisor**: the update script stops the Supervisor, keeping the user app running.
3. **Fetch update**: attempt delta update via balenaEngine; fall back to full pull from registry or Docker Hub.
4. **Apply to spare partition**: format the inactive root partition and unpack the new OS image.
5. **Update Supervisor**: if the new OS includes a newer Supervisor, upgrade it.
6. **Switch boot**: configure bootloader to use the new partition on next reboot.
7. **Reboot**: device restarts into the updated OS.

> **Note**: Logs for update failures are in `/mnt/data/balenahup/` (or `/mnt/data/resinhup/`).
