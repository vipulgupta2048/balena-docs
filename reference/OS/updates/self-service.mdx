## Supported scenarios

balenaCloud supports self-service host OS upgrades between all balenaOS 2.x releases and from 1.x → 2.x. Development and production images both qualify. When deltas are available (most 2.x → 2.x paths) the updater uses them automatically to minimise bandwidth.

:::warning 1.x to 2.x data limit
Upgrading from balenaOS 1.x caps the `/data` partition at roughly 170 MB compressed. Larger payloads cause the update to abort without modifying the device. Clean up or offload data before retrying.
:::

If a device type or version is missing from the dropdown, raise a ticket via the [forums](https://forums.balena.io/); we continually expand coverage.

## Run a host OS update

1. Open the device page and switch to **Settings → OS version**.
2. Pick the target version from the dropdown.
3. Click **Save**—the update begins immediately.

For fleet-wide updates:

1. On the fleet device list, select the devices you want to upgrade (online devices only).
2. Click **Modify → OS version**.
3. Choose the desired release and select **Apply**.

:::info Supervisor updates
Host OS updates may include a newer Supervisor, but you can also [trigger Supervisor-only upgrades](/reference/supervisor/supervisor-upgrades) when you want to stay on the same OS.

## Monitoring progress

- The device summary shows a step-by-step progress indicator. Long-running phases (image download, write) may stall visually; refresh the page if needed.
- Each update emits timeline events and logs. Investigate failures at `/mnt/data/balenahup/` (or legacy `/mnt/data/resinhup/`).
- Update duration depends on network throughput, storage performance, and whether a delta or full image is required.

If an update fails, the previous OS remains active and your application keeps running. Address the error (network reachability, disk space, broken SD card) and retrigger when ready. Contact the [Troubleshooting forum](https://forums.balena.io/c/troubleshooting) if you need help interpreting the balenahup logs.

## Update locks

[Update locks](/learn/deploy/release-strategy/update-locking/) let applications defer updates while running critical sections. Host OS upgrades require an **exclusive** lock; shared locks do not block them. Override locks deliberately only when you accept the risk of interrupting your workload.

Review the [Host OS update process](/reference/OS/updates/update-process) for a detailed walkthrough of each phase.
