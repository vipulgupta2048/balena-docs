## Introduction

balenaOS uses **NetworkManager** (with **ModemManager**) for flexible connectivity—ethernet, Wi-Fi, and cellular.

Configure connections via files in the boot partition under `/system-connections`.

## Wi-Fi Setup

If you added Wi-Fi when flashing, you’ll find a `resin-wifi` file:

```ini
[connection]
id=balena-wifi
type=wifi

[wifi]
ssid=MySSID
mode=infrastructure

[wifi-security]
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=MyPassword

[ipv4]
method=auto

[ipv6]
method=auto
```

Copy and customize for additional networks. Use `autoconnect-priority` to prefer one over another.

## Ethernet Setup

Ethernet works out of the box. To customize (e.g. shared mode):

```ini
[connection]
id=shared-ethernet
type=ethernet
interface-name=eth0

[ipv4]
method=shared

[ipv6]
method=shared
```

## Setting a Static IP

Add to your `[ipv4]` section:

```ini
address1=192.168.1.100/24,192.168.1.1
dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;
method=manual
```
