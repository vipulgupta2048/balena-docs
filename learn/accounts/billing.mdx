## Overview

Billing lives at the organization level. To review or update billing, select an organization in the dashboard and open the **Billing** tab.

![Billing navigation](https://docs.balena.io/img/common/billing/billing_nav.webp)

From here you can switch plans, update payment details, download invoices, monitor usage, and purchase credits. For help with billing, contact [solutions@balena.io](mailto:solutions@balena.io).

## Change plans

Click **Change plan** to upgrade or downgrade.

## Work with credits

Credits let you pre-pay for overage device usage. On paid plans (Pilot and above), you can purchase credits to reduce month-end overage charges. The more credits you buy (and the more existing credits you hold), the better your rate.

View and manage credits from the **Credits** tab.

![Credits navigation](https://docs.balena.io/img/common/billing/credits_nav.webp)

The credits dashboard shows purchase history, remaining balance, and lets you initiate new purchases. balena automatically applies available credits before charging overages in arrears.

<Warning>
Credits expire 10 years after purchase. If no credit activity occurs for two consecutive years, balena may cancel outstanding credits after providing 60 days' notice. Credits are non-refundable, non-transferable between organizations, and only apply to Microservices fleets. Purchase credits at least 24 hours before the monthly billing renewal.
</Warning>

## Understand dynamic billing

Usage above your plan allowance (after applying credits) is billed monthly in arrears. balena calculates overage based on the peak number of active devices and collaborators during the billing period.

- Every device that is active (online or offline) counts toward usage.
- Users are billed at the highest role they held during the period (for example, a user promoted to Developer for a week counts as Developer for the whole month).

Line items for additional usage appear under **Add-ons** on your invoice. You can pre-purchase additional allowances (for example, with credits) if you prefer to avoid dynamic charges.

## Deactivate inactive devices

If devices will remain powered off for extended periods, mark them **Inactive** to pay a one-time deactivation fee instead of ongoing usage. Inactive devices are excluded from monthly counts until they come back online. Deactivate devices from the [device settings page](/learn/manage/actions/#deactivate-device).

## Inactive vs. offline

- **Inactive**: The device was [deactivated](/learn/manage/actions/#deactivate-device) or preregistered but has not yet connected to the balenaCloud API.
- **Offline**: The device currently lacks Cloudlink connectivity and has not contacted the API recently.

Offline devices that remain active still count toward billing because they can receive updates once they reconnect. After you deactivate a device, you cannot monitor or update it until it is reactivated.

## Device freezing

Overdue invoices cause balenaCloud to freeze devices in that organization. Frozen devices continue running their existing containers, but you cannot manage them from the dashboard until payment is resolved. A snowflake icon marks frozen devices. Update your payment method or email [solutions@balena.io](mailto:solutions@balena.io) to restore access.
