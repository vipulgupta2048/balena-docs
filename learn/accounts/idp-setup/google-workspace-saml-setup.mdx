## Overview

This guide walks through building a Google Workspace SAML identity provider for balenaCloud. When finished, download the metadata file and [upload it to balenaCloud](/learn/accounts/enterprise-sso/#link-a-saml-identity-provider) to complete the connection.

<Info>
You need Google Workspace super-admin access to create SAML apps and assign them to users or groups.
</Info>

## Step 1: Open the Admin console

Sign in to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/unified) with an administrator account.

## Step 2: Add a custom SAML app

1. Click **Add app**.
2. Choose **Add custom SAML app**.

## Step 3: Name the app and download metadata

1. Enter a descriptive name such as `balenaCloud SSO`.
2. Download the metadata file when prompted. You will upload this file to balenaCloud later.

## Step 4: Configure service provider details

1. Provide the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL:

```text
https://api.balena-cloud.com/auth/saml/<sso-identifier>/callback
```

2. Provide the Entity ID:

```text
https://api.balena-cloud.com/auth/saml/<sso-identifier>
```

Replace `<sso-identifier>` with the identifier you plan to use in balenaCloud (for example, `acme`).

## Step 5: Skip attribute mapping

balenaCloud does not require additional attribute mappings, so you can leave this section unchanged.

## Step 6: Enable the app for users

Set the app **Service status** to **ON** for everyone or for the groups that should access balenaCloud. Only enabled users can sign in via SSO.

## Step 7: Review the configuration

Confirm the app appears in your list of custom SAML apps.

## Finish the integration

Upload the metadata file in balenaCloud by following the [Enterprise SSO instructions](/learn/accounts/enterprise-sso/#link-a-saml-identity-provider). Once linked, users in the enabled groups can sign in through Google Workspace SSO.
