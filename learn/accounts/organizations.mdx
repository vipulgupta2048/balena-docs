## Overview

Organizations group members, teams, fleets, and billing under a single umbrella. Administrators manage access, plan subscriptions, and shared resources, while members receive scoped access to the fleets they need.

<Info>
Every balenaCloud user automatically owns a personal organization named after their username. It behaves like any other organization but cannot be deleted.

## What you can do with organizations

- Invite users and assign roles.
- Create teams and grant access to fleets in bulk.
- Manage billing per organization.
- Move fleets between organizations or share them with collaborators.

## Create an organization

1. In the dashboard sidebar, open **Organizations**.
2. Click **Create organization**.
3. Enter a name and confirm. You become the first administrator automatically.

Administrators can delete organizations they manage. Any member can leave an organization via the organization summary page.

## Roles and access

Organizations offer two roles:

- **Administrator** - Full control over members, teams, fleets, billing, and subscriptions.
- **Member** - Read access to the organization plus any fleets or teams explicitly granted.

### Invite members

1. Open the organization and click **Manage members**.
2. Choose **Invite member**.
3. Enter the user's email or balena username and assign a role.

To change roles later, select the member, choose **Actions â†’ Change membership**, and pick the desired role.

## Create teams

Teams group members so you can assign fleet access collectively.

1. Open the **Teams** tab and click **Create team**.
2. Name the team and confirm.
3. Use **Manage members** and **Manage fleets** to add people and grant access.

## Create fleets within an organization

Within the organization, open the **Fleets** tab and click **Create fleet**. Follow the standard fleet creation workflow (see the [Getting started guide](/learn/getting-started)).

### Move existing fleets

To move a fleet into another organization, transfer ownership from the fleet's **Settings** page. See [Transfer fleet ownership](/learn/manage/actions/#transfer-fleet-ownership) for details.

## Grant fleet access

Assign fleet roles to individuals or teams:

- **Individual members**: Open the member's profile, click **Manage fleets**, then **Add to fleets** and choose the role (Developer, Operator, Observer).
- **Teams**: From the team summary, click **Manage fleets** followed by **Add fleets to team** to assign roles for each fleet.

To revoke access, return to **Manage fleets**, select the relevant fleets, and choose **Remove access**.

## Collaborate on a single fleet

If you only need to share one fleet, invite users directly as [fleet members](/learn/accounts/fleet-members). balenaCloud automatically adds them to the owning organization with the appropriate access levels.
