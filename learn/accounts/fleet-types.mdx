## Overview

All new fleets in balenaCloud use the Microservices type, which supports [multicontainer deployments](/learn/develop/multicontainer) and features such as [public device URLs](/learn/manage/actions/#public-device-url). Older accounts may still run Essentials, Classic, or Legacy fleetsâ€”this guide explains the differences and how to upgrade.

<Info>
Since March 2023, balena no longer creates new Essentials, Classic, or Legacy fleets. Existing fleets continue to operate, and you can still provision devices to them.

## Legacy fleet types

Essentials, Classic, and Legacy fleets run a single container per device and do not support public device URLs.

- **Essentials**: Single-container fleet with limited features.
- **Classic**: Supports balenaOS v2.0.3 and newer, using Docker Registry v2.
- **Legacy**: Supports earlier balenaOS versions and uses the deprecated Registry v1.

All Microservices and Essentials fleets require balenaOS v2.12.0 or later. If a device type does not yet offer that version, new fleets default to Classic.

## Convert to Microservices

To upgrade an existing fleet:

1. Ensure every device in the fleet runs a balenaOS version that meets Microservices requirements. [Update devices](/reference/OS/updates/self-service) if needed.
2. Open the fleet summary page.
3. Click **Settings** and locate **Fleet type**.
4. Choose **Microservices** from the dropdown.

balenaCloud disables fleet types that are incompatible with your devices, so if Microservices is unavailable, update the remaining devices first.
