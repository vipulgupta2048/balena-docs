## Access device interfaces

Single-container fleets run in [privileged mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#privileged) by default, so they inherit `/dev` access much like a standard Linux environment. That means you can talk to serial buses, sensors, and displays without extra configuration.

Multicontainer fleets start with tighter defaults. Grant access explicitly by either:

- Setting `privileged: true` on the service, or
- Adding specific capabilities and devices via `cap_add` and `devices`.

Example service exposing I2C and UART peripherals:

```yaml
gpio:
  build: ./gpio
  devices:
    - "/dev/i2c-1:/dev/i2c-1"
    - "/dev/mem:/dev/mem"
    - "/dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0"
  cap_add:
    - SYS_RAWIO
```

<Warning>
If you are not using one of the [recommended balena base images](https://docs.balena.io/reference/base-images/balena-base-images/), you may need to manage `/dev` updates yourself by configuring [udev](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udev.html).
