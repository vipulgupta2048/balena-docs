## What is a block?

A block is a container image that delivers a focused capability—Bluetooth handling, sensor ingestion, dashboards, and more. Instead of rewriting the same boilerplate, add a block to your multicontainer fleet and reuse proven functionality.

Blocks are built to:

- Reduce time-to-first-value by shipping preconfigured services.
- Encourage modular architectures where each capability lives in its own container.
- Simplify sharing functionality across projects and organizations.

## Add a block to your fleet

Blocks are just container images, so include them in `docker-compose.yml` alongside your services:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '2'

services:
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host

  balena-node-hello-world:
    build: ./balena-node-hello-world
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - browser
    ports:
      - "80"

  importantBananaDb:
    image: importantBanana/db:latest
    ports:
      - "8080"
    environment:
      DB_ROOT_PASSWORD: 'potassium'
      RUN_MODE: 'super-secure'
```

Each block documents required [docker-compose fields](https://docs.balena.io/reference/supervisor/docker-compose/) in its README. Pay attention to privileged and networking settings, and avoid conflicting port bindings.

## Create your own block

Blocks follow the same fundamentals as any container service. Keep the project in a GitHub repository and include a `balena.yml` file at the root so balenaHub can display metadata:

```yaml title="balena.yml"
name: browser
description: >-
  a hardware accelerated web browser to present internal and external URLs on a
  connected display
version: 2.3.2
type: sw.block
assets:
  repository:
    type: blob.asset
    data:
      url: 'https://github.com/balenablocks/browser'
  logo:
    type: blob.asset
    data:
      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balenablocks/browser/master/logo.png'
data:
  defaultDeviceType: raspberrypi3
  supportedDeviceTypes:
    - raspberrypi4-64
    - fincm3
    - raspberrypi3
    - raspberrypi3-64
    - raspberrypi400-64
    - intel-nuc
    - genericx86-64-ext
```

Once the repository is ready:

1. Open the **Blocks** tab in the balenaCloud dashboard.
2. Click **Create block** and fill in the metadata.
3. Push your first release with [`balena push`](https://docs.balena.io/learn/deploy/deployment/#balena-push).

## Release management

Track, pin, and promote releases directly from the dashboard. By default, blocks **track latest**, so the newest successful build becomes the default image.

</Frame>

To ship a new version:

```bash
balena push <BLOCK_SLUG>
```

Select a specific release in the dashboard if you want to pin the default image instead of following latest.

## Publish on balenaHub

Keep blocks private while you iterate. When you are ready to share:

1. Add the repository URL under **Settings → Repository URL**.
2. Toggle **Block visibility** to **On**.

</Frame>

Public blocks appear in the [balenaHub Blocks](https://hub.balena.io/blocks) catalog, complete with image references and usage docs.

## Use blocks in other projects

The balenaHub listing provides an image URL you can paste into a Dockerfile or compose file. For example:

```yaml
services:
  browser:
    image: bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64/2.3.8
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
```

Notes on versioning:

- `2.3.8` resolves to the most recent revision (for example `2.3.8+rev2`).
- Draft releases require the full build stamp (`2.4.1-1648554962021`).
- You can target a specific build by commit hash: `bh.cr/balenablocks/browser-aarch64/11e1ee23d7ddf6ab6da99bac26c9d274`.

<Note>
The `+` character is reserved in image references, so specify the base version and balena will automatically use the latest revision for that release.
</Note>

BalenaHub keeps the canonical image reference handy—click **Use** to copy it and drop the block into any fleet.
