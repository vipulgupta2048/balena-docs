## Overview

Apps bundle multiple services into a reusable unit that can be deployed to any balena fleet. They are ideal when you want to share turnkey functionality—either privately within an organization or publicly via balenaHub.

<Warning>
Apps are currently an experimental feature. Enable them under **Preferences → Experimental Options → Display Apps** in the balenaCloud dashboard.
</Warning>

Apps can stand alone or incorporate [blocks](https://docs.balena.io/learn/develop/blocks). Publish them to [balenaHub](https://hub.balena.io) so any fleet owner can deploy your work, or keep them private for internal reuse.

## Why build an App?

- Deliver a complete, multi-container solution that deploys without extra wiring.
- Reuse the same functionality across fleets you own or manage for others.
- Share community projects—such as [balenaSense](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sense), built from the [dashboard](https://github.com/balenablocks/dashboard) and [connector](https://github.com/balenablocks/connector) blocks—through balenaHub.

## Create an App

1. Store your project in a **public GitHub repository** (private repositories are not yet supported).
2. Add a `balena.yml` file in the repo root to describe metadata, variables, supported device types, and assets.
3. In the balenaCloud dashboard, open the **Apps** tab and choose **Create App**.
4. Complete the creation modal, then push your first release using familiar workflows like [`balena push`](https://docs.balena.io/learn/deploy/deployment/).

Example `balena.yml` from [balenaDash](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-dash):

## Publish on balenaHub

By default Apps remain private to your organization. When you are ready to share:

</Frame>

1. In the App **Settings** view, add the GitHub repository URL.
2. Toggle **App visibility** to make it public on balenaHub.
3. Toggle visibility off at any time if you need to withdraw the listing.

Public Apps appear in balenaHub search and can be deployed directly into another user’s fleet.

## Deploy an App from balenaHub

<Frame>

</Frame>

When someone clicks **Deploy** on balenaHub:

1. balenaCloud prompts them to sign in (or create an account) and select a target fleet.
2. The balena builders fetch the latest code from the repository listed in `balena.yml`.
3. A fresh release is created for the chosen fleet using the [Deploy with balena button](https://docs.balena.io/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/) workflow.

## Manage support access

If balena support needs to investigate an App, enable temporary access in **Settings → Support access**. The toggle automatically reverts to **Off** once the requested window expires.

</Frame>

## Release management

Use the balena CLI to push new releases:

```bash
balena push <APP_SLUG>
```

The **Releases** tab lists build history. You can also pin an App to a specific release so balenaHub shows that version as the public build, even though hub deployments always fetch the latest commit from GitHub.

## Transfer App ownership

Transfer an App—and all its members and releases—between organizations when needed:

1. Confirm the **target organization** has an empty App with the same name.
2. Ask a target organization admin to add you as a **Developer** on that App (skip this if you are already an admin there).
3. In the source organization, go to **Settings → Set App ownership** and choose the new organization.

<Info>
If the destination dropdown is disabled, double-check that the target organization created an App with the exact same name and that you have access as a member.
</Info>

After transfer, the original owner is removed from the App; invite them back if they still need access. All other members retain their roles.

## Roadmap

Apps today enable public sharing via balenaHub. Future milestones include:

- Private Apps on private fleets.
- Automatic updates between App versions.
- Installing multiple Apps onto a single fleet.

Follow the [balena blog](https://www.balena.io/blog) for feature announcements.
