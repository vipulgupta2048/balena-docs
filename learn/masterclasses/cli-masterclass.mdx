# Balena CLI Masterclass

* **Masterclass Type:** Core
* **Maximum Expected Time To Complete:** 60 minutes

## Introduction

The balena Command Line Interface (balena CLI) utility consists of a number
of commands that allow a user to develop, deploy and manage balena fleets, as
well as manage configuration & variables of the fleet and balenaOS images.

Almost everything that can be achieved via the balenaCloud dashboard can also be
achieved via the balena CLI.

In this masterclass, you will learn how to:

* Login to your account
* Push your first release to a balena fleet
* Deploy locally built code to a balena fleet
* SSH into a balena device
* Push and build a release on the device over local network for fast
    development and prototyping
* Use private Docker registries for base images and services
* Create secret files and build arguments for building service images

If you have any questions about this masterclass as you proceed through it,
or would like clarifications on any of the topics raised here, please do
raise an issue as on the repository this file is contained in, or contact
us on the [balena forums](https://forums.balena.io/) where we'll be
delighted to answer your questions.

The location of the repository that contains this masterclass and all associated
code is
[https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli-masterclass](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli-masterclass).

## Hardware and Software Requirements

It is assumed that the reader has access to the following:

* A locally cloned copy of this repository
	[Balena CLI Masterclass](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli-masterclass).
	Either:
  * `git clone https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli-masterclass.git`
  * Download ZIP file (from 'Clone or download'->'Download ZIP') and then unzip it to a suitable directory
* A balena supported device, such as a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
	or [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html). If you don't have a device, you can emulate an Intel NUC by
	installing VirtualBox and following [this guide](https://www.balena.io/blog/no-hardware-use-virtualbox/)
* A suitable text editor for developing code on your development platform (eg.
    [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
* A suitable shell environment for command execution (such as `bash`)
* A [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/) account
* A local installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/)
	as well as a familiarity with [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
* Should you wish to install via `npm`, a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
	installation, including [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is required.
	The use of [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
	is recommended, which allows you to alter the version of Node/NPM being used
	per-user, and also removes the need to install global dependencies using
	`sudo`

## Exercises

All of the following exercises assume that you are running the balena CLI from
a suitable Unix-based shell. The exercises include commands which can be run
in such a shell and are represented by a line prefixed with `$`. Information
returned from the execution of a command may be appended under the line to show
what might be returned. For example:

```shell
$ balena version
11.9.3
```

### 1. Installation and Authentication

#### 1.1 Installation

First, we need to install balena CLI. The easiest way to achieve this is to use
the installers for your OS from the
[balena CLI releases page](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/releases).
Choose the installer for your OS, download it, and follow [the instructions](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
Note that there is not currently an installer for Linux, but you
can download the standalone binary and then move it to a relevant location.

The alternative way to install it is via `npm` on a system running NodeJS.
Open a terminal on your development machine and run the following command:

```shell
$ npm --global install balena-cli
```

This will install the balena CLI globally and allow you to run it in a terminal
via `balena <command>`. Note that, depending on how you've installed NodeJS
and NPM, you may need to prefix this command with `sudo`. Also, if you get an
error such as `EACCES: permission denied`, add param `--unsafe-perm` right
after `--global`

#### 1.2 Authentication

To use balena CLI, you need to log into a balenaCloud account. If you don't
have one, you can use the dashboard
[here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) or sign up with the
login command by selecting `I don't have a balena account!`. Either way,
login via the terminal:

```shell
$ balena login
 _            _
| |__   __ _ | |  ____  _ __    __ _
| '_ \ / _` || | / __ \| '_ \  / _` |
| |_) | (_) || ||  ___/| | | || (_) |
|_.__/ \__,_||_| \____/|_| |_| \__,_|


Logging in to balena-cloud.com
? How would you like to login? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Web authorization (recommended)
  Credentials
  Authentication token
  I don't have a balena account!
```

You will be asked how you wish to authenticate with balenaCloud. The
easiest method is that of 'Web authorization' which will bring up a browser
window (and ask you to first login to balenaCloud if you have not) and ask you
to confirm you wish to login.

Other authentication methods include using your username and password
credentials or authentication token. Authentication tokens come in two types,
API tokens and JSON Web Token (JWT) session tokens. Whilst API tokens do not
expire, JWT session tokens do after 7 days.

Once logged in, a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) session token will be saved in your
home directory (`~/.balena/token`). Be aware that the lifetime of a balena
JWT is limited to seven days, after which time reauthentication will be
required.

### 2. Creating a Fleet and Provisioning a Device

#### 2.1 Creating a Fleet

Fleets can be created via the dashboard or via the balena CLI. We're going
to create a new fleet via balena CLI called `cliFleet`. Run the following
command:

```shell
$ balena fleet create cliFleet
```

This will ask you which device type you wish to create the fleet for.
You can scroll up and down this list using the arrow keys. For now, exit
the command by hitting `Ctrl-C`, as there's another, non-interactive way to
do this which we'll use instead. Type:

```shell
$ balena device-type list
```

to see a list of all supported device types by balenaCloud. For the rest of
this masterclass we're going to assume you're using a balenaFin, but you can
just as easily use any supported balena device.
We'll pass the balenaFin device type (`fincm3`) to the fleet creation
command directly:

```shell
$ balena fleet create cliFleet --type fincm3
Fleet created: slug "admin/clifleet", device type "fincm3"
```

As can be seen, this will return the fleet's slug and device type.
If you're using a different device type, pass the appropriate device type
to the `balena fleet create` command instead.

Non-interactive commands are useful when you need to script actions via
balena CLI for a shell script (although balena also includes HTTPS endpoints and
SDKs which can be used for this purpose).

You can list the fleets currently owned by (or shared with) your account
by typing:

```shell
$ balena fleet list
ID       NAME     SLUG           DEVICE TYPE   ONLINE DEVICES DEVICE COUNT
1234567  cliFleet admin/clifleet fincm3        0              0
```

#### 2.2 Provisioning a Device

You can now provision your balenaFin by downloading a provisioning image from
the balenaCloud dashboard. Be sure to download a development image, as we'll
be utilizing its features later.

Once the provisioning image is downloaded, connect your balenaFin to your development machine and run
[Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
to
[flash it](https://www.balena.io/fin/1.1/docs/getting-started/#Flashing-the-OS).

Once the image has been flashed to the balenaFin it will register itself and
connect to the balenaCloud VPN, showing up in the dashboard and being viewable
using balena CLI:

```shell
$ balena device list
ID      UUID    DEVICE NAME      DEVICE TYPE  FLEET NAME STATUS IS ONLINE SUPERVISOR VERSION OS VERSION           DASHBOARD URL
7654321 1234567 restless-glade   fincm3       cliFleet                  true                                              https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/devices/12345678901234567890123456789012/summary
```

You can get detailed information on a device by using its Universally Unique
Identifier (UUID), for example:

```shell
$ balena device 1234567
== RESTLESS GLADE
ID:                 7654321
DEVICE TYPE:        fincm3
STATUS:             idle
IS ONLINE:          true
IP ADDRESS:         192.168.1.173
FLEET NAME:         cliFleet
UUID:               12345678901234567890123456789012
SUPERVISOR VERSION: 9.15.7
IS WEB ACCESSIBLE:  false
OS VERSION:         balenaOS 2.38.0+rev1
DASHBOARD URL:      https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/devices/12345678901234567890123456789012/summary
```

UUIDs can either be used in their shortened version (as above) or in their
long version (for example, the `DASHBOARD URL` field in the output above
shows the entire UUID for the device).

Be aware that there are ways to download, configure and provision a fleet
image via balena CLI, but as some extra work is required to create a provisioning
image (to allow greater flexibility) we'll go into that in the advanced
masterclass.

### 3. Pushing Code to a Device

Once a fleet has been created, we want to be able to push a release to it.
There are a couple of ways to do this, but the most common is that of using
`balena push`. See the [balena push](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deployment/#balena-push) docs to learn more about the command. 
Alternatively, you can use legacy method of pushing code via `git push`. You
can learn about how to do so by going to the [git push](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deployment/#git-push) docs. Before moving
on to the next step, make sure you know how to push code to a device.

### 4. SSHing into a Device

Once a device has been provisioned, it can be accessed by SSHing into it via the 
balenaCloud VPN. To do this, you need to [add your public SSH key](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/ssh-access/#add-an-ssh-key-to-balenacloud) to your BalenaCloud 
account. When added, specify the UUID of the device you want to SSH into 
(remember you can see all your devices by running `balena device list`).

```shell
$ balena device ssh 1234567
=============================================================
    Welcome to balenaOS
=============================================================
root@827b231:~#
```

By default, SSH access is routed into the host balenaOS shell. However, you
can SSH into a service by specifying its name as part of the command:

```shell
$ balena device ssh 1234567 main
root@827b231:/usr/src/app#
```

This also works in multi-container fleets, simply pass the name of the
appropriate service as defined in `docker-compose.yml` you'd like to access
the shell for.

When using device UUIDs, `balena device ssh` uses the balena VPN to create a secure
tunnel to the device and then forward SSH traffic between it and your
development machine (for production devices, this is the only available method).

For devices running development images on your local network, you can also
use SSH by specifying the hostname or IP address of that device (development
images have SSH enabled by default). Using `balena device ssh` in this way doesn't use
the balena VPN and instead makes a direct SSH connection to the device.
For example:

```shell
$ balena device ssh 192.168.1.2
```

To find the hostname of a local development device, you can use `balena device detect`:

```shell
$ sudo balena device detect
Reporting scan results
-
  host:          827b231.local
  address:       192.168.1.173
  dockerInfo:
    Containers:        1
    ContainersRunning: 1
    ContainersPaused:  0
    ContainersStopped: 0
    Images:            2
    Driver:            aufs
    SystemTime:        2019-09-05T13:31:34.910619617Z
    KernelVersion:     4.14.98
    OperatingSystem:   balenaOS 2.38.0+rev1
    Architecture:      armv7l
  dockerVersion:
    Version:    18.09.6-dev
    ApiVersion: 1.39
```

In this instance `827b231.local` is the hostname, so the device can be SSHd
into using `balena device ssh 827b231.local`. Note that by default, the hostname
of a device is always its short UUID, so if you already know the UUID for the
device, you can `balena device ssh <uuid>.local` without having to perform a
`balena device detect`.

### 5. Building and Deploying a release without the Builder

#### 5.1 Building an Image on a Development Machine

Whilst you can build the release image using the balenaCloud builder, it's also
possible to build and generate the release's Docker images locally
on your development machine.

There are several reasons why you want might to do this. For example, should
your development machine exist on an air-gapped network (with no Internet
connection), but the base images for a build as well as all the other
package requirements your build will need, also exist on the local network, this
allows builds for balena devices to still be carried out.

Another good example is if you have your own CI/CD pipeline with dedicated
machines that cache specific package/build data that you use frequently. In
these cases, a build on a local machine may be significantly quicker than
using balena generic builders.

Before we try building locally, it's worth a note on an extra switch that can be
used with `balena build`. `--emulated` tells balena CLI that the target
architecture environment should be emulated, if it differs from that of the
native architecture on which balena CLI is being run. For example, most
development machines tend to use an x64 architecture, whereas a large number of
devices are based around Armv6 or v7 (and more lately v8) architectures. To
correctly build images for Arm targets, an x64 builder must emulate the target
architecture whilst running the Docker commands. Because we're assuming the use
of a balenaFin here, we'll run all local builds using the `--emulated` switch.
Should you be building for an Intel NUC, or other AMD64 based device, you do not
need to pass this switch in the following examples.

To carry out a local build requires more information than a `balena push`,
because balena CLI needs to know the CPU architecture and device type to produce
a Docker image that will work on the specified target. The easiest way to do
this is to specify a fleet, which will allow balena CLI to determine this
information itself by querying the balenaCloud API. In the
`balena-cli-masterclass` repository, execute this command:

```shell
$ balena build --fleet cliFleet --emulated
[Info]    Creating default composition with source: /Work/Support/MasterClasses/repos/balena-cli-masterclass
[Info]    Building for armv7hf/fincm3
[Info]    Emulation is enabled
[Build]   Built 1 service in 1:32
[Build]   main Image size: 208.45 MB
```

A call to `docker images` will show the newly built image:

```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                     TAG                                        IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
balena-cli-masterclass_main    latest                                     321025486d49        About a minute ago   219MB
```

As mentioned, there are instances where the ability to use balenaCloud is not
possible (for example an air-gapped network), or is not desirable. In these
situations, `balena build` can be notified of the device type and architecture
to build on the command line. To get the architecture of each supported device,
execute this command:

```
balena devices supported -v
```

Once you know the architecture and device type of the device you want to emulate,
execute this command to start building:

```shell
$ balena build --arch armv7hf --deviceType fincm3 --emulated
[Info]    Creating default composition with source: /Work/Support/MasterClasses/repos/balena-cli-masterclass
[Info]    Building for armv7hf/fincm3
[Info]    Emulation is enabled
[Build]   Built 1 service in 1:41
[Build]   main Image size: 219.15 MB
[Success] Build succeeded!
```

There are a few caveats to building images locally, however. Emulated builds
will always be slower than native builds due to having to mimic a different
architecture. Coupled with other factors, such as potentially lower
network bandwidth than that enjoyed by the balenaCloud builders, this can
mean a far slower build than would occur than pushing to our native builders
(which use both dedicated 64bit AMD64 and Arm servers).

#### 5.2 Deploying an Image from a Development Machine

An image from a development machine can be deployed as a fleet release
to balenaCloud from balena CLI. This allows any pre-built image to be uploaded
directly to balena's registry without the requirement of the builder to
generate it first. Assuming you've followed exercise 5.1, run the following:

```shell
$ balena deploy cliFleet balena-cli-masterclass_main:latest
[Info]    Creating default composition with image: balena-cli-masterclass_main:latest
[Info]    Everything is up to date (use --build to force a rebuild)
[Info]    Creating release...
[Info]    Pushing images to registry...
[Info]    Saving release...
[Success] Deploy succeeded!
[Success] Release: b9e5ec4b309f91281ecb592028dcea0c

			    \
			     \
			      \\
			       \\
			        >\/7
			    _.-(6'  \
			   (=___._/` \
			        )  \ |
			       /   / |
			      /    > /
			     j    < _\
			 _.-' :      ``.
			 \ r=._\        `.
			<`\\_  \         .`-.
			 \ r-7  `-. ._  ' .  `\
			  \`,      `-.`7  7)   )
			   \/         \|  \'  / `-._
			              ||    .'
			               \\  (
			                >\  >
			            ,.-' >.'
			           <.'_.''
			             <'
```

This will create a new release (visible via the dashboard), and push the image
directly to the balena Docker registry. Your balenaFin should then download the
new release and run it. This is useful if you already have an image pre-built
and just need to upload it.

However, `balena deploy` also allows you to complete the build step as well
implicitly by not specifying an image to upload. Run the following command in
the `balena-cli-masterclass` repository:

```shell
$ balena deploy cliFleet --build --emulated
[Info]    Creating default composition with source: /Work/Support/MasterClasses/repos/balena-cli-masterclass
[Info]    Building for armv7hf/fincm3
[Build]   Built 1 service in 0:58
[Build]   main Image size: 213.80 MB
[Info]    Creating release...
[Info]    Pushing images to registry...
[Info]    Saving release...
[Success] Deploy succeeded!
[Success] Release: 13f39923c2ddf95fa35a129d8efb5b53

			    \
			     \
			      \\
			       \\
			        >\/7
			    _.-(6'  \
			   (=___._/` \
			        )  \ |
			       /   / |
			      /    > /
			     j    < _\
			 _.-' :      ``.
			 \ r=._\        `.
			<`\\_  \         .`-.
			 \ r-7  `-. ._  ' .  `\
			  \`,      `-.`7  7)   )
			   \/         \|  \'  / `-._
			              ||    .'
			               \\  (
			                >\  >
			            ,.-' >.'
			           <.'_.''
			             <'
```

This forces the `deploy` command to first build (or rebuild if the image already
exists) the project before pushing it to the Docker registries.

### 6. Using Local Mode to Develop your Application

So far, you've seen how to push code to the balena builders or to build and
push images on a development machine. Whilst practical solutions for pre-tested
code, or for a CI pipeline, this is not a fast workflow for active development
of an app by an engineer as it involves rebuilding an image and then
delivering it to the target device.

To make active development of app easier for an engineer, balena
devices provisioned with a development image include a device mechanism called
'Local Mode'. This can be activated easily from the dashboard. Go to your
device's dashboard page, select 'Settings' from the lefthand toolbar, and then
select 'Local mode'. Local mode does a couple of important things:

* Stops running the services currently associated with the device
* Exposes a Docker socket on the local network

Once activated, balena CLI can push code directly to the local device instead
of going via the balena builders. Code is built on the device and then executed,
which can significantly speed up development when requiring frequent changes.
As mentioned previously, you can find local devices on your network in
development mode by using `balena device detect`.

`balena push` includes optional switches which allow you to specify that you
want to push code to a local device using the results from `balena device detect`.
To see this working in practice, carry out a `balena device detect`, and then pass either
the host or IP address to `balena push` whilst in the `balena-cli-masterclass`
repository:

```shell
$ balena push 827b231.local

Once the code has been built on the device, it immediately starts executing
and logs are output to the console. You can halt the connection to the local
device by using `Ctrl-C`. Note that after disconnection, the service containers
on the device will continue to run.

In a multi-container environment, it may quickly become difficult for an engineer
to determine whether their code is working, especially if many services are
all outputting log information. In these cases, filtering log output via
service is possible, by using the `--service` switch (we've also used the
`--nocache` option here to force a rebuild and restart, else we wouldn't see any
other logs as the service wouldn't have changed):

As you can see, none of the Supervisor logs were printed. Note that there is
also a `balena device logs` command that is dedicated to just showing logs. This
command includes both the `--system` and `--service` switches to filter
output to just that of system messages or particular service messages (these
switches can be combined in a single `balena device logs` call). This allows the
setup of multiple terminals to act as loggers whilst another is used to
carry out `balena push` executions. A few examples of logging are shown below:

* `balena device logs 827b231.local --system --service main` - Will output all
	system messages and those from the `main` service
* `balena device logs 827b231.local --service main` will only output messages from
	the `main` service
* `balena device logs 827b231.local --service main --service secondary` will only
	output messages from the `main` and `secondary` services

Local Mode also has another huge benefit, known as Livepush.
[Livepush](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/livepush) makes intelligent
decisions on how, or even if, to rebuild an image when changes are made. It
does this by examining the source directory of an image being built on your
local development machine (via balena CLI) and then deciding how to deal with
changes.

In some cases, Livepush rebuilds relevant parts of the image before starting the
new image as the service. As an example of this, ensure you've executed
`balena push` in Local Mode:

```shell
$ balena push 827b231.local --service main
```

Now modify `Dockerfile.template` in the `balena-cli-masterclass` repository in a
text editor, inserting a new line between the `COPY src/ ./src/` command and
`CMD ["npm", "start"]`:

```shell
...
COPY src/ ./src/

RUN echo "Rebuild the image"

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Finally, save the changes to the file in your text editor. The Supervisor
will immediately detect that the Dockerfile has changed and will start a rebuild
of the service:

```shell

```

Once rebuilt, it will restart the service. Notice that the `Rebuild the image`
echoed line is now in the build log.

Livepush goes way further than this, however. Only files that affect the
building of the service force a rebuild. For other files, for example source
files that run in-service, the Supervisor replaces the files in-situ in the
relevant container layer.
To show this, continue to run the `balena push` command and then alter the
`src/helloworld.js` in a text editor and change:

```shell
console.log('Hello world!');
```

to

```shell
console.log('Hello moon!');
```

On saving the file, you'll see the following output:

```shell
[Live]    Detected changes for container main, updating...
[Live]    [main] Restarting service...
[Logs]    [9/5/2019, 4:02:27 PM] [main]

[Logs]    [9/5/2019, 4:02:28 PM] [main] Hello moon!
```

Instead of rebuilding the image, which takes time, the file is injected directly
into the container's file system and then it is restarted. This happens in a
few seconds and makes the process of developing much faster and more convenient.

Sometimes an engineer may not want to rebuild code 'on the fly'. For this reason</s>
`balena push` in Local Mode also has a `--nolive` option which can be passed
to it. When using this switch, engineers need to re`push` when they want to
rebuild code.

Livepush also supports `balena device logs`, and can be used in the same way as
described earlier.

### 7. Using Private Registries

As well as using public Docker registries it's possible to instruct builders,
either balena-based or using Local Mode, to pull images from private Docker
registries. This is achieved by using the `--registry-secrets` switch when
calling `balena push` passing a filename containing the secret information.
This information can be in either YAML or JSON. For example, a relevant
JSON object containing this information follows:

```json
{
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
		"username": "myUser",
		"password": "myPassword"
	}
}
```

If saved as a JSON file, for example `secrets.json`, it will then be used when
a base image or image for a service is pulled which requires credentials:

```shell
$ balena push --registry-secrets secrets.json
```

You can also save a file with secrets in JSON or YAML format in your home
directory, under `~/.balena/secrets.<yml|json>`, which will automatically be
used for the secrets if it exists and the `--registry-secrets` switch has not
been passed to `balena push`.

### 8. Building with Secrets and Variables

Building images occasionally requires the use of credentials (such as those
for private repositories), or environment variables that may change depending
on circumstances such as architecture (for example package versioning).

The following exercise sections show you how to use build-time secrets and
variable substitution.

#### 8.1 Build Time Secrets

Sometimes it is necessary to build images using secret information, commonly
to login to source repositories or fetch data that is required for the building
of an image, but which should not exist *in* that image when run as a service
container.

Our builders allow you to do this by adding such secrets in files in a
`.balena` directory in the root of the build directory. This allows them to
be passed to builders, which will use (and then discard) them for generating
images.

We'll make a few changes to the example project to show this in operation.
First, create a `.balena` directory in the root of the `balena-cli-masterclass`
directory, and then create an empty `balena.yml` file and create another
directory called `secrets` in the `.balena` directory. You should now have a
file tree that looks like this:

```shell
$ tree -a -I .git
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .balena
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ balena.yml
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile.template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helloworld.js
```

You can now add secrets to the build by adding a section to the `balena.yml`
file and then creating appropriate secret files in the `.balena/secrets`
directory. We'll add some now, open a text editor and fill the `balena.yml`
file with the following:

```yaml
build-secrets:
  global:
    - source: my-build-secrets
      dest: my-secrets
```

Note that the source file should exist in the `.balena/secrets` directory, and
that it is mapped into the `my-secrets` file when the image is built.
Save the file, and create a new one called `.balena/secrets/my-build-secrets`
and copy the following into it:

```shell
This file has build-time secrets!
```

Finally, we'll add a line into our Dockerfile that uses the secrets file, which
is mapped into the `/run/secrets/` directory during build time:

```shell
COPY src/ ./src/

RUN cat /run/secrets/my-secrets

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Now, push the project to the builders:

```shell

			             <'
```

As you can see, step 6 output:

```shell
[main]     Step 6/7 : RUN cat /run/secrets/my-secrets
[main]      ---> Running in 949098cba8b6
[main]     This file has build-time secrets!
```

which is the contents of the secrets file. This file could obviously contain
a raft of different functions, including a script that gets executed, text
for filling in files, etc. As well as defining globally accessible secrets
(which are shared to all services being built), there is also the option to
define secrets that are only accessible to particular services, or to map them
to different paths. This becomes useful in multi-container build scenarios. This
can be achieved by appending a `services` section to `build-secrets` on the
`balena.yml` file. For example:

```yaml
build-secrets:
  services:
    main:
      - source: main-only-secrets
        dest: my-main-secrets
```

This change would map the `.balena/secrets/main-only-secrets` file into the
`/run/secrets/my-main-secrets` runtime path at build-time but *only for the
`main` service*.

#### 8.2 Build Time Variables

Another frequent build-time use is that of environment variables that may alter
between builds but still use the same flow of a Dockerfile. Allowing these to
be defined dynamically means that no changes to a Dockerfile are required as
long as the variables are referenced within them.

Much in a similar way to secrets files, these are defined in the
`.balena/balena.yml` file. Add two new build-time arguments to your
`balena.yml` file:

```yaml
build-variables:
  global:
    - BUILD_TIME_ARG_1=This is the first arg
    - BUILD_TIME_ARG_2=This is the second arg
```

Now alter the Dockerfile to use them:

```Dockerfile
RUN cat /run/secrets/my-secrets

ARG BUILD_TIME_ARG_1
ARG BUILD_TIME_ARG_2

RUN echo "${BUILD_TIME_ARG_1}" && \
    echo "${BUILD_TIME_ARG_2}"

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Note that you need to ensure that both arguments are declared using the `ARG`
Docker command. Save the file and push to the builders:

```shell

As can be seen, both build arguments were available in the log output:

```shell
[main]     This is the first arg
[main]     This is the second arg
```

In the same way that build secrets can be made service specific, so may secret
build arguments, by specifying them directly in the `.balena/balena.yml` file:

```yaml
build-variables:
  services:
    main:
      - MAIN_ONLY_BUILD_ARG=This is only available when building 'main'
```

An important note for build variables is that, unlike secrets, they will be
defined and available as part of the final image. If you need variables to
be secret, they should be defined specifically as secrets.

## Conclusion

In this masterclass, you've learned how to use the most commonly used balena CLI
commands, as well as how to start development using it. You should now be
familiar and confident enough to:

* Create fleets for specific device types
* Provision devices as well as SSH into balenaOS and any running service
	container
* Push a release to fleets, either via `balena push` or `git push`
* Locally build service images on a development machine, as well as deploying
	those images to balenaCloud
* Switch a development device into Local Mode, push code locally to a device
	to build, and debug the app faster.
* Use Livepush to dynamically alter the app code on the fly and immediately
	see results on a device in Local Mode, as well as filter log output for
	specific services in the app. 
* Use build secret files and arguments to generate images which
	should not include those secrets, as well as build variables
