## Overview

balenaCloud surfaces the health of every device through two related signals:

- **Device status** reflects connectivity to Cloudlink (VPN) and heartbeat polling.
- **Update status** tracks how far the device has progressed toward the target release.

Use both to decide whether a device can receive actions, deploy updates, or needs attention.

## Device statuses

Devices appear with one of the following states on the fleet list, device summary, and fleet overview pages:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Operational** | The device is communicating with balenaCloud within the normal interval. Both Cloudlink and the Heartbeat API are healthy. If [Cloudlink is disabled](/reference/supervisor/bandwidth-reduction/#side-effects--warnings), the heartbeat alone keeps the device operational. |
| **Reduced functionality** | One connectivity path is missing—either the Heartbeat API has not reported recently or Cloudlink is offline. The device is still online but certain actions are unavailable. |
| **Disconnected** | The device lost both Cloudlink and heartbeat connectivity for longer than the configured poll interval. The device cannot send or receive updates. |
| **Configuring** | The device is applying host OS configuration, such as enabling a setting or finishing an OS update. |
| **Updating** | The device is installing a new application release. Future updates will also surface OS updates here. |
| **Post provisioning** | The device has been provisioned but has not yet booted from internal storage (for example, eMMC or NVMe). |
| **Inactive** | The device was [deactivated](/learn/accounts/billing/#inactive-devices) or preregistered but has not connected to the balenaCloud API yet. |
| **Frozen** | The device was frozen because it exceeds the organization allowance or belongs to a paid fleet type on a free-tier organization. |

## Connectivity indicators

The device list shows boolean columns for Cloudlink and heartbeat connectivity.

![Device connectivity indicators](https://docs.balena.io/img/common/main_dashboard/device_status.webp)

- **Cloudlink = true, Heartbeat = false**: Supervisor cannot reach the API. Deployments, configuration variables, and other state changes will not apply, but remote access (web terminal, SSH) still works. Run a [health check](/reference/diagnostics/#device-health-checks) and review [device diagnostics](/reference/diagnostics/#device-diagnostics) to investigate.
- **Heartbeat = true, Cloudlink = false**: The device can poll the API for updates, but immediate actions (restart, purge, reboot, shutdown) and Cloudlink-only features like [SSH access](/learn/manage/ssh-access) are unavailable. Check for VPN traffic blocked by a firewall.

<Note>
If the device powers off, the heartbeat indicator remains green until the next polling window elapses. After the poll interval passes without contact, the device transitions to **Disconnected**.
</Note>

## Update statuses

Devices running Supervisor 16.7.0 or newer report granular update states:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Done** | The device finished applying the target release and is in sync. |
| **Downloading** | The Supervisor is pulling container images for the new release. |
| **Downloaded** | All images are stored locally. If the device holds an [update lock](/learn/deploy/release-strategy/update-locking), it stays in this state until the lock releases (subject to the configured [update strategy](/learn/deploy/release-strategy/update-strategies/#controlling-the-update-strategy)). |
| **Applying changes** | The Supervisor is stopping old containers, updating volumes, networks, and applying other changes from the new release. |
| **Rejected** | The target release requires services that do not meet [container requirements](/learn/develop/multicontainer/#container-requirements). |
| **Aborted** | The Supervisor gave up on installing the release (reserved for future conditions such as repeated download failures).

<Info>
Update status data currently focuses on application releases. While host OS updates are underway, the device status shows **Configuring** with additional context—for example, `Configuring (Update successful, rebooting)`.
</Info>

## Update status duration

The dashboard displays an **Update status duration** that measures how long the device has remained in its current update state. When you query the data from the API you receive a timestamp. The duration resets whenever the status changes.

<Note>
Supervisor interprets app restarts or reboots the same way as fresh installations, so the update status duration refreshes after those events.

## Need deeper troubleshooting?

If the indicators above do not explain a device state, work through the [device debugging masterclass](https://docs.balena.io/learn/more/masterclasses/device-debugging) for step-by-step remediation guidance.
