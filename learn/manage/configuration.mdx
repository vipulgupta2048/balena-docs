## Overview

Configuration variables let you change host OS and Supervisor behavior without rebuilding your services. Variables always start with the `BALENA_` or legacy `RESIN_` prefix and can be scoped at the fleet or device level.

<Note>
Configuration changes made in the dashboard do not apply while a device is in [local mode](/learn/develop/local-mode).
</Note>

Beginning with Supervisor v7.0.0, many supported variables appear automatically in the dashboard as soon as a device provisions. Fleet administrators can activate, override, or delete those defaults directly from the UI.

## Explore available variables

In addition to [service variables](/learn/manage/variables), you can manage behavior with Supervisor and device-type specific options. The [configuration list](/reference/supervisor/configuration-list) documents every supported variable along with valid values and minimum Supervisor versions.

## Manage configuration at the fleet level

Fleet configuration applies to every device in the fleet unless a device override exists.

1. Open the fleet **Configuration** tab and find the variable you want to change.
2. Click **Activate** to enable a default variable, or use the toggle for boolean values.
3. Select the pencil icon to edit other values, or the trash can icon to remove the fleet-wide override and revert to the default.

<Info>
Device-level overrides appear beneath the fleet configuration list. Use **Define fleet-wide** to promote a device value to the entire fleet.
</Info>

If you need to clear overrides for specific devices, choose **Overrides** to delete the device-specific values and restore the fleet defaults.

## Manage configuration at the device level

Device configuration affects only that device and overrides matching fleet-level settings.

- Toggle boolean variables directly in the table.
- Click the pencil icon to edit other values; a modal opens with the current setting.
- Delete the variable to return to the fleet default (or the Supervisor default if no fleet setting exists).

## Replace the boot splash screen

Upload a custom splash image by activating **Define the PNG image to be used for the boot splash screen. Only supported by Supervisor versions >= v12.3.0.** on the fleet or device configuration page, then provide your PNG file.

## Add custom configuration

Use **Add custom configuration** to define variables beyond the predefined list. Custom entries must still begin with the `BALENA_` (or legacy `RESIN_`) prefix.

1. Scroll past the predefined options and choose **Add custom configuration**.
2. Enter the variable name and value, then click **Add**.

Device-specific custom configuration follows the same workflow. Select **Override** on a custom fleet variable to change its value for a single device.

<Info>
You can also manage configuration through the API, SDK, or CLI. See the [Node.js SDK reference](/reference/sdk/node-sdk) and [balena CLI documentation](/reference/balena-cli/#envs) for example workflows.
