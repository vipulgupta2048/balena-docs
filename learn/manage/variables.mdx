## Overview

Variables expose runtime configuration to your services without rebuilding images. Define variables in the dashboard, API, CLI, or SDK and balenaCloud injects them as environment variables inside the targeted services.

![Accessing variable](https://docs.balena.io/img/variables/accessing_variables.webp)

<Note>
Dashboard-defined variables do not apply while a device runs in [local mode](/learn/develop/local-mode).
</Note>

## Precedence and scope

Variables can target the entire fleet, a specific device, or an individual service. When the same variable name exists in multiple scopes, precedence is:

1. **Device + service**
2. **Device (all services)**
3. **Fleet + service**
4. **Fleet (all services)**

Changing a fleet-wide variable for all services restarts every service in the fleet. Changing a variable scoped to a particular service only restarts that service.

<Info>
Values can be up to 1 MB each. Devices re-download variables whenever the API state changes, which can increase [Supervisor bandwidth usage](/reference/supervisor/bandwidth-reduction/#side-effects--warnings). Tune the polling interval with `BALENA_SUPERVISOR_POLL_INTERVAL`.
</Info>

## Manage fleet variables

1. Open a fleet and select the **Variables** tab.
2. Click **Add variable**.
3. Choose **All services** or a specific service, then set the name and value.

![Add fleet variable](https://docs.balena.io/img/variables/add_fleet_variable.webp)

The variable appears in the list where you can edit or delete it.

<Info>
Deleting a fleet variable does not remove device-level overrides with the same name.
</Info>

If a device already defines the same variable, the override appears beneath the fleet entry. Promote the device value to the fleet with **Define fleet-wide**.

## Manage device variables

Device variables apply to a single device and override fleet values.

1. Open the device summary page and choose **Device Variables**.
2. Click **Add variable**, pick the service scope, then provide the name and value.
3. Use **override** to change the value of a fleet variable for that device only.

## Automate with CLI and SDKs

Manage variables programmatically with the balena tooling:

- [`balena env` commands](https://docs.balena.io/tools/cli/#envs)
- [Node.js SDK environment API](/reference/sdk/node-sdk/#balena.models.fleet.envVar)
- [Python SDK environment API](/reference/sdk/python-sdk/#environmentvariable)
