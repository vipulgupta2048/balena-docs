## Overview

Use this hub to troubleshoot the most common balenaCloud and device issues. Start with the general fixes below, then jump to device-specific notes for additional LED patterns, boot tips, and hardware quirks.

<Info>
Device-specific sections expand over time. If you need guidance for a device not yet listed, visit the [forums](https://forums.balena.io/) or contact support.
</Info>

## General fixes

### Terminal closes during an update

When you push a new release, the web terminal closes automatically because containers restart. Wait for the update to finish, then launch a new terminal session from the dashboard.

### Problems signing in to the dashboard

Browser extensions or ad blockers can prevent social logins from working. Whitelist `*.balena-cloud.com` (and other balena domains) or disable extensions such as BrowserShark temporarily while you authenticate.

### Scripts fail with `$'\r': command not found`

Windows adds carriage returns to line endings, which bash interprets as `\r`. Configure Git to convert line endings to LF on checkout. See [GitHub's Windows guide](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-windows) for instructions.

### Device repeatedly drops from Wi-Fi

Noisy 2.4 GHz networks can cause intermittent connectivity. Try a 5 GHz-capable Wi-Fi adapter or relocate the device away from interference sources.

### "Unsupported syscall: 384" when building with QEMU

This warning appears when emulating an architecture that lacks the `getrandom(2)` system call. QEMU falls back to `/dev/urandom`, so you can ignore the message.

### Device never shows up in the dashboard

If a device remains offline after 10 minutes:

- Confirm Wi-Fi credentials or Ethernet connections (see [network requirements](/reference/OS/network#network-requirements-and-proxies)).
- Check LED indicators against the device's error codes.
- Connect an HDMI display to verify the OS booted properly. If you see rainbow bars or a blank screen, reflash the SD card.

If you still cannot connect, gather [device diagnostics](/reference/diagnostics/#device-diagnostics) and reach out via [balena support](https://www.balena.io/support).

### "This is the wrong balena device" error

Check for the following issues:

- Missing or corrupted `config.json`
- Mismatched UUID in `config.json`
- Attempting to SSH into the wrong device IP address

Contact support if the issue persists after validating the configuration.

## Device-specific troubleshooting

### Raspberry Pi family

#### Device does not boot

Check the ACT LED against the [Raspberry Pi error codes](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Green_LED_blinks_in_a_specific_pattern). If no codes appear, connect a monitor via HDMI to capture boot logs. A Raspberry Pi 2 requires a Pi 2-specific balenaOS image; Pi 1 images will not boot.

#### Connectivity issues

If the dashboard shows the balena logo with a prompt to check connectivity, verify Ethernet or Wi-Fi credentials. If the indicator LED never displayed an error, let support know when you report the issue.

#### SD card corruption

A `recovery login` prompt usually indicates a corrupted SD card. Reformat the card and reflash the image. Replace the media if problems continue.

#### LED error codes

- **Four flashes**: Device cannot reach the internet. Confirm network credentials and open the ports listed in the [network requirements](/reference/OS/network#network-requirements-and-proxies). If problems continue, ask for help on the [forums](https://forums.balena.io/).
- **Seven flashes**: Boot loader cannot find `kernel.img`. Make sure you flashed an image that matches your hardware (for example, Raspberry Pi 2 vs. Raspberry Pi 1).
- **Power warning icon**: A flashing rainbow square indicates insufficient power. Try a higher-quality power supply and USB cable. The Raspberry Pi wiki has more details on [power troubleshooting](http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Troubleshooting_power_problems).

### NVIDIA Jetson family

#### Jetson Nano will not boot balenaOS

Jetson Nano devices shipped with L4T 32.5 or newer store boot firmware in QSPI flash. If the board only boots the NVIDIA Ubuntu image, use [Jetson Flash](https://github.com/balena-os/jetson-flash) once to program the initial balenaOS boot chain. After that, future updates come through the dashboard.

<Warning>
Never interrupt a balenaOS update on Jetson hardware. Loss of power or network connectivity during the update can brick the device, requiring a full reflash.
</Warning>

#### Identify the installed L4T version

Run `uname -a` to view the kernel version and L4T release. You can also check the [balena Jetson repository](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson/tree/master/layers/meta-balena-jetson/recipes-bsp/tegra-binaries) for the mapping between balenaOS releases and L4T versions.

#### Custom device trees

Only Jetson Nano and Jetson TX2 devices (with U-Boot support) allow custom device trees. Follow the instructions in the [hardware guide](https://docs.balena.io/learn/develop/hardware/i2c-and-spi/#jetson-devices) to apply them.
