There are occasionally instances where a problem arises which is not immediately
obvious. In these cases, you might see services fail 'randomly', perhaps
attached devices don't behave as they should, or maybe spurious reboots occur.

If an issue isn't apparent fairly soon after looking at a device, the
examination of the kernel logs can be a useful check to see if anything is
causing an issue.

To examine the kernel log on-device, simply run `dmesg` from the host OS:

The rest of the output is truncated here. Note that the time output is in
seconds. If you want to display a human readable time, use the `-T` switch.
This will, however, strip the nanosecond accuracy and revert to chronological
order with a minimum granularity of a second.

Note that the 'Device Diagnostics' tab from the 'Diagnostics' section of a
device also runs `dmesg -T` and will display these in the output window.
However, due to the sheer amount of information presented here, it's sometimes
easier to run it on-device.

Some common issues to watch for include:

- Under-voltage warnings, signifying that a device is not receiving what it
  requires from the power supply to operate correctly (these warnings
  are only present on the Raspberry Pi series).
- Block device warnings, which could signify issues with the media that balenaOS
  is running from (for example, SD card corruption).
- Device detection problems, where devices that are expected to show in the
  device node list are either incorrectly detected or misdetected.
